<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;MY ARREST.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a dreary afternoon in November,
cheerless and foggy as befitted the occasion, and accompanied by
that gentle rain which we are told &ldquo;falleth on the just and
on the unjust,&rdquo; I suddenly, though hardly unexpectedly,
found myself in the hands of the law, as represented by a burly
policeman in a waterproof cape and a strong Somersetshire
accent.&nbsp; The circumstances that led up to this momentous
change can be briefly described.&nbsp; I had gone to the office
of a solicitor&mdash;one White, with whom I had had previous
monetary transactions&mdash;with reference to a new loan on a
bill of exchange; and it must be distinctly understood that any
allusions I may make to this individual&rsquo;s <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>vocations are
not to be misinterpreted, for I have the highest respect for his
integrity and aptitude for business, legal or otherwise, and
cannot but admire (as I&rsquo;m sure every honest reader will)
the horror with which any dishonest act inspired him, which,
though it did not deter him from conscientiously completing the
transaction as a matter of business, was equally swift in
retributive justice, and condemnatory (to use his own expression)
of compounding a felony.&nbsp; Mr. White, in short, is a
money-lender, who, in addition to the advantages derivable from
his legal assistance, is always prepared on undoubted
security&mdash;such as a bill of sale or a promissory
note&mdash;to make cash advances at the rate of 240 per
cent.&nbsp; I am justified in quoting this as the
gentleman&rsquo;s rate of interest, for I paid him &pound;5 for a
loan of &pound;45 for fourteen days, a transaction that his
cheque on a Holborn bank will testify.&nbsp; The only marvel that
suggests itself to my mind is, that a person who is so scrupulous
in refusing to &ldquo;compound a felony,&rdquo; as he termed it
when he assisted in involving me in the meshes of the law, should
retain the ill-gotten and usurious sum of &pound;5 one moment
after he was aware (as he has been for a year) that it was the
proceeds of a <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>forgery.&nbsp; But perhaps I am wronging the worthy man;
he may have subscribed it towards the Hunt he honours with his
patronage, or have paid it as his subscription to the London and
Discounty Club, to which, I presume, he belongs.</p>
<p>At first sight this rate of interest may appear somewhat high,
but a moment&rsquo;s reflection will dispel the idea.&nbsp; Here
was a gentleman, a member of the honourable profession of the
law&mdash;one who (as he told me) actually hunted with Her
Majesty&rsquo;s hounds, and, for aught I know, may have been
honoured with a nod from the Master of the Buckhounds&mdash;one,
moreover, who occasionally dined with impecunious Irish lords,
with whom he had transacted business, and talked of such
aristocratic clubs as the &ldquo;Wanderers&rsquo;&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Beaconsfield&rdquo; with as much <i>sang-froid</i> and a
degree of familiarity such as you and I, gentle reader, might
refer to the &ldquo;Magpie and Stump&rdquo; at Holloway, and
which to me at the time was truly appalling; here, I say, was a
gentleman endowed with all these recommendations actually
condescending to minister to one&rsquo;s pecuniary wants; and one
would indeed have been unworthy of such advantages had one carped
or squabbled over such <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>vulgar trifles as a paltry 240 per
cent.&nbsp; There is certainly another point of view from which
this &ldquo;financial&rdquo; business may be regarded; but if the
Master of the Rolls and the &ldquo;Incorporated Law
Society&rdquo; take no exception to this occupation of one of
their members, it is clearly no business of ours to find fault
with a gentleman who materially adds to his income by combining
the profitable trade of usury with the profitless profession of
the law.</p>
<p>It is a prevalent and very erroneous impression to associate
voracity and sharp dealings with the Hebrew race, for I&rsquo;ve
found from experience (and I&rsquo;m admittedly an authority)
that for meanness, haggling, and exorbitant terms, with a cloak
of hypocrisy to cover this multitude of sins, the Hebrew is
considerably out-distanced by his Christian
<i>confr&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; I might indeed go a step further,
and add, that, barring a repellent manner during the
preliminaries of a transaction, but which is purely superficial,
the dealings of the children of Israel are based on strictly
honourable and considerate grounds.&nbsp; No one has ever heard
of a Jew robbing you first and then prosecuting you; they are
invariably satisfied with one course or the other.&nbsp; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>(I may here be
permitted a slight digression to note that I intend ere long to
publish a list of usurers never before attempted, based on my
personal experience of them, including members of almost every
trade and profession, and which for completeness and accuracy of
detail will put to the blush the hitherto feeble attempts of such
society journals as <i>Town Talk</i>, <i>Truth</i>, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>At about four o&rsquo;clock, then, on this dreary November
afternoon I found myself with three or four others in Mr.
White&rsquo;s waiting-room.&nbsp; I verily believe one of my
companions was a detective, a suspicion that subsequent events
tend to confirm.&nbsp; In the frowzy room I found myself waiting
for more than an hour, during which time my naturally &rsquo;cute
disposition, coupled with a consciousness of guilt, convinced me
with a &ldquo;suspeeciun&rdquo; similar to that of the old lady
at the subscription ball at Peebles, &ldquo;amoonting to a
positive ceertainty&rdquo; that something was up.&nbsp; This
apprehension was by no means allayed by my distinctly seeing the
shadow of the burly policeman, in cape and helmet, on the frosted
window, as he ascended the stairs; and had I been so inclined,
there was nothing to have prevented me from at once <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>burning the
damning document then in my pocket and walking down-stairs.&nbsp;
But I was perfectly callous and indifferent to the result;
indeed, I can only attribute my feelings at the time to those of
a madman who hailed with delight any change that substituted
incarceration and an unburthened mind for liberty and an uneasy
conscience.&nbsp; The rest of the incidents in this prologue are
easily told, and the next ten minutes (which abounded with
sayings and doings, however commendable from a moral point of
view, sadly out of place in a usurer&rsquo;s parlour) found me in
a cab, in company with a policeman, with Mr. White, money-lender,
solicitor, and commissioner to administer oaths, on the box, his
&lsquo;fishy&rsquo; partner inside, and driving at the rapid rate
habitual to the fleetest four-wheelers of three miles an hour en
route to Bow Street.&nbsp; Luck now favoured me, and I was
fortunate enough to obtain an interview with Mr. Vaughan, who was
on the eve of departure, and who, in a few hurried and
well-chosen words, and in a metallic tone of voice that I can
only, with all respect, compare to the vibrations of the
telephone, which I heard some years ago in its infancy, conveyed
to me the momentous intelligence that I was <i>remanded</i> till
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Tuesday.&nbsp; This was by no means my first appearance
at Bow Street Police Court, for though not on so serious a charge
as the present, I had on a former occasion made the acquaintance
(officially) of the worthy magistrate.&nbsp; The circumstances
are briefly these, and though in no way bearing on my present
narrative, may be reasonably introduced, as a combination of
sweets and bitters, such as one gleans by the advertisements, are
to be associated with &ldquo;chow-chow,&rdquo; &ldquo;nabob
pickles,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; Some four years ago I had
the honour of accompanying a well-known but not equally
appreciated young baronet, and High Sheriff of an Irish county,
notorious for his &ldquo;Orange&rdquo; (and orange-bitters with a
dash of gin) proclivities, to a low music-hall.&nbsp; The weather
was hot, and the evening an exceptionally warm one in June, such
an one, indeed, that the most abstemious might have been pardoned
for exceeding the bounds of moderation.&nbsp; About midnight we
presented ourselves at the portals of that virtuous but defunct
institution, and were refused a box on the plea of
inebriation.&nbsp; So indignant, however, were both myself and my
blue-blooded if not blue-ribboned companion at this monstrous
insinuation <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>that we at once proceeded to Bow Street, and laid a
formal complaint with the inspector on night duty.&nbsp; The
books, and probably that official&rsquo;s marginal notes, would
doubtless place facts and our respective intellectual conditions
at the time beyond the shadow of a doubt.&nbsp; For my own part,
I confess (with that frankness that has always been my ruin) that
if I was not absolutely inebriated, I was decidedly
&ldquo;fresh.&rdquo;&nbsp; As regards my companion, however, I
will not presume to venture an opinion, although High Sheriffs
admittedly never get drunk;&mdash;is it likely, then, that this
one, the pride of his county and an ornament to its Bench, could
so far forget himself?&nbsp; Absurd!&nbsp; The sequel, however,
has yet to be told; and a few nights afterwards, about 9 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, alone, and disguised as a gentleman
in evening clothes, I went to the Night House and requested to
see the proprietor.&nbsp; A bilious individual hereupon came into
the passage, and, supported by a crowd of &ldquo;chuckers
out,&rdquo; hurled me on to the verandah, where luck and my
proximity to the worthy publican enabled me to deal one blow on a
face, which eventually turned out to be that of Barnabas Amos;
but a member of &ldquo;the force&rdquo; happened to be passing,
and the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>gentle Amos, not content with having previously taken the
law into his own hands with questionable success, now appealed to
the constable, and, in short, gave me in charge for an
assault.&nbsp; I will not weary the reader by a description of my
detention for twenty minutes in the police station, till I was
bailed out by a householder; nor of the proceedings next morning
before the magistrate.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the case was
dismissed; that the daily papers honoured me by devoting half a
column to a report of the case; that six months after, alone and
unaided, I opposed the renewal of the licence for the
night-house; that my thirst for revenge was thoroughly satiated;
and that I had the gratification of depriving the Amos of a
weekly profit of &pound;300, besides about &pound;500 for legal
expenses; and that the Middlesex magistrates did their duty and
proved themselves worthy of their responsible position by almost
unanimously refusing the licence, despite the fervid and well
fee&rsquo;d eloquence of Solicitor-General and voracious
barristers, and thus stamped out about as festering a heap of
filth and garbage as any that had ever infested this modern
Babylon.&nbsp; Mr. Barnabas Amos and I were thenceforth quits,
and, barring a <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>chuckle he no doubt had at my subsequent troubles (such
as a less magnanimous person than myself might have had at his
eventual bankruptcy), I may fairly congratulate myself on having
had the best of the little encounter.&nbsp; But another feature
of this case suggests itself, and I cannot dismiss this long
digression without a few words in conclusion.&nbsp; My quasi
friend, the High Sheriff, did not come well out of this
matter.&nbsp; We had, as it were, rowed in the same boat on this
eventful night, we had both been refused a box on the same
grounds, and yet he left me to bear, not only the brunt of the
police-court row, but, by a judicious silence, got me the credit
of having tried but signally failed to lead him from the paths of
rectitude and virtue.&nbsp; I am prepared to make every allowance
for a man in his position, lately married to a young and innocent
wife, whose ears it was only right should not be polluted with
such revelations as a night-house would naturally suggest if
associated with her husband&rsquo;s name; and I was perfectly
alive to the necessity of screening him, and willing that my name
only (as it did) should appear in the proceedings; nevertheless,
there is a right and a wrong way of attaining <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>such an end,
and the High Sheriff will, I am convinced, on reflection, admit
that he might have attained the same result in a more
straightforward manner, and have spared the feelings of his bride
and possibly her younger sisters equally as well without leaving
a &ldquo;pal&rdquo;&mdash;to use a vulgar expression&mdash;in the
lurch without an apology.&nbsp; With this digression I will
return (in the spirit) to Bow Street, and close the chapter with
a bang such as accompanied the closing of my cell door, and await
the arrival of &ldquo;Black Maria.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOUSE OF DETENTION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> a delay of about twenty
minutes&mdash;when for the first time I found myself an inmate of
a police cell&mdash;a very civil gaoler (with the relative rank
of a Police Sergeant) announced to me, with a &ldquo;Now,
Captain,&rdquo; the arrival of one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s
carriages.&nbsp; One has frequently heard of the Queen&rsquo;s
carriages meeting, and not meeting, distinguished personages,
such as Mr. Gladstone, Sir Garnet Wolseley, the King of the
Zulus, and German princelings; but the carriage I refer to must
not be confused with this type.&nbsp; They are far from
comfortable, the accommodation is limited, and the society
questionable; and had it not been for the courteous consideration
of the conductor (a Police Sergeant) I should have been
considerably puzzled in attempting to squeeze my huge bulk of 19
stone 13 lbs. (as verified a few minutes later in <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Her
Majesty&rsquo;s scales) into a compartment about 16 inches in
breadth.&nbsp; As a fact, however, I remained in the passage, and
thus obtained a view of streets and well-known haunts under very
novel and degrading conditions.&nbsp; Everyone appeared to stare
at this van, and everyone seemed to me to particularly catch my
eye; but this, of course, was pure fancy, resulting, I presume,
from a guilty conscience&mdash;for within the dark tunnel of this
centre passage it was impossible that anyone in the streets could
see, much less distinguish, anyone inside.&nbsp; I discovered a
few weeks later that these uncomfortable police vans were
infinitely superior and more roomy than those attached to Her
Majesty&rsquo;s prisons; in fact, I should say they were the only
attempt (as far as I could discover) at making a distinction
between an untried, and consequently innocent (vaunted English
law&mdash;twaddle) person, and a convicted prisoner.</p>
<p>My experiences at the &ldquo;House of Detention&rdquo; and
subsequently at &ldquo;Newgate&rdquo; convince me that justice
demands a great alteration in the rules regarding untried
prisoners, who are allowed and disallowed certain newspapers at
the caprice of the chaplain, and actually restricted as to the
class of <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>eatables their friends may send them.&nbsp; An instance
of this occurred in my case.&nbsp; A kind friend one day brought
me a hamper containing, as I was informed, a roast fowl and a
tongue; the warder at the entrance-gate, however, told him that
these were luxuries in the estimation of the Home-office, and
therefore less suited to the palate of an untried (and
consequently innocent) man than a chop or steak fried in tallow
and procured from the usual eating-house; and as my friend had
dragged this white elephant of a parcel about with him for some
time, he gave it bodily to the turnkey, who consequently reaped
the advantage of the intended kindness to me.&nbsp; Next morning
I complained to the Governor, who assured me he should have made
no objection to the &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; of a fowl; in short, I
had been the victim of the zeal of an illiterate and astute
official, who, putting two and two together, and weighing the
probable effect of his veto on an inexperienced inhabitant of the
outer world, had arrived at a very happy arrangement whereby I
was deprived and he benefited to the extent of a well-selected
hamper.&nbsp; I found the Governor a very good sort.&nbsp; His
suit of dittos was a little of the &ldquo;thunder and
lightning&rdquo; pattern; but <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>if his clothes were loud, his manners
were not&mdash;in short, he was essentially a gentleman, both in
appearance and manners, a beau ideal of the heavy dragoon that
existed before the Cardwellite era.&nbsp; I purposely refer to
his manners being those of a gentleman because it does not always
occur that those situated in a similar position possess the
higher recommendation.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;House of Detention&rdquo; appeared to me the most
awfully depressing place to which my erring footsteps had ever
led me.&nbsp; The darkness, the stillness, the novelty of the
situation, all tended to this conclusion; and I cannot do better
than describe what occurred, and leave the verdict in the hands
of the reader.&nbsp; Conceive then a man, who an hour previously
was a free citizen, suddenly finding himself stepping out of a
police van into a gloomy, white-washed passage, and being
inspected and counted with a dozen others by a bumptious turnkey,
puffed out with his own importance, addicted, as I have
previously mentioned, to cold fowl and tongue, but otherwise
oblivious to the veriest rudiments of civilization.&nbsp;
Conceive, then, the sensations of a man such as I, finding
himself suddenly confronted by such a biped, who, scanning <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>first a paper
and then you, begins to drawl out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
name?&nbsp; Your age?&nbsp; Married or single?&nbsp; Protestant
or Romanist?&rdquo; and a volley of such like rubbish, which only
tends to exasperate one, and which might well be dispensed with,
seeing that all the desired information is on the paper, and,
having been supplied by one&rsquo;s self not an hour before, is
sure to be corroborated, whether correct or not, and considering,
too, that this farce is repeated every time you enter and leave
the place, and which in a case of frequent remands might occur
twice a day.&nbsp; One can hardly narrate a single item regarding
the treatment of an untried prisoner that does not call for
redress, <i>i.e.</i>, if the absurd theory is still persisted in
that an untried man is an innocent one.&nbsp; What right has an
innocent man to be debarred the privilege of seeing friends
(under reasonable restrictions) as often as he pleases, instead
of being limited to one visit of fifteen minutes a day?&nbsp; Why
should one be allowed to purchase <i>Town Talk</i> and not
<i>Truth</i>?&nbsp; Why should the <i>Graphic</i> be permitted
and not the <i>Dramatic News</i>?&nbsp; These are anomalies no
logic can explain away, and have no right to be left to the
caprice of a prison official.&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The food supply as at present
arranged is a cruel system; a prisoner under remand is gratified
at hearing that he may procure his own food, and naturally
shrinks at the idea of subsisting on prison fare till absolutely
compelled.&nbsp; No greater mistake ever was made&mdash;the
latter is good, clean, and supplied gratis; the former is nasty
in the extreme, and scandalously dear.&nbsp; If the doubtful
&ldquo;privilege&rdquo; is to be continued, it is time the
government, in common fairness, controlled the tariff; at present
a prisoner is at the mercy of the eating-house keeper, and liable
to any charge he may choose to make.&nbsp; I must admit that the
caterers for the &ldquo;House of Detention&rdquo; were civil and
comparatively reasonable, whereas those at Newgate were exactly
the opposite.&nbsp; I shall give a detailed account later on of
how I was fleeced at the Old Bailey, and I would earnestly warn
all prisoners awaiting trial to stick to the prison fare, and
carefully to avoid the refreshments supplied from the cat&rsquo;s
meat houses in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; With these slight
digressions I shall proceed to a description of the routine at
the &ldquo;House of Detention,&rdquo; with its rules and
regulations and privileges, and the impressions they conveyed to
me; and I <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>cannot do better than impress on the reader that this
book makes no pretensions to literary merit, but must be regarded
rather as a journal of facts, whose principle claim is based on
their having been written by a man who is probably as well known
as any in England.&nbsp; I ask no praise, I&rsquo;m equally
oblivious to abuse; criticism I&rsquo;m absolutely indifferent
to, being convinced that either my notoriety, my popularity, my
identity, or unpopularity, will procure me readers far in excess
of any book of greater merit; and it is a consolation to feel
that my friends will be glad that I got through some months with
a degree of comfort never before paralleled, and my enemies (male
and especially female) will be chagrined at discovering that
&ldquo;Imprisonment with Hard Labour&rdquo; in my case meant
kindness from first to last hardly credible, absolutely devoid of
any labour at all, and accompanied with luxuries as regards
eating and drinking that could not have been surpassed had I been
stopping at a first-class hotel and paying thirty shillings a day
for board and lodging.&nbsp; Many apparent contradictions may
moreover suggest themselves, but taken in the light of a diary,
these contradictory views must be regarded as reflecting <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>circumstances
as they appeared to me from time to time under various
phases.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that I have carefully avoided
exaggeration, that everything I narrate can be fully
substantiated, and may be unhesitatingly accepted as the
experiences of a man endowed with an average amount of brains,
who kept his eyes wide open, and who had opportunities given him
that no man ever had before, whether higher or lower in the
social or criminal scale, of seeing a vast amount of the
&ldquo;dark side of nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; In my innocence I once
fancied I had seen a good deal, and knew a lot; but the following
narrative will prove that I was a very babe and suckling, before
I became a &ldquo;Government ward.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heaven forbid
that anyone should purchase his experience at such a price;
nevertheless, on the principle that has guided me through life of
trying to see everything and do everything, I can only attempt to
justify my escapades by endorsing the theory (slightly altered)
of the immortal Voltaire, that a man who would go through what I
have is &ldquo;<i>un fois un philosophe</i>, <i>mais deux fois un
criminel d&eacute;termin&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;SETTLING DOWN.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fresh</span> arrivals appear to come to
this awful place at every hour of the day and night.&nbsp; The
police courts belch forth their motley loads on an average about
twice a day, and when the Sessions are &ldquo;on,&rdquo;
prisoners arrive as late as nine and ten of a night, and the
rumbling of &ldquo;Black Marias,&rdquo; the shouting of warders,
the turning of keys, the slamming of doors, and a hundred other
&ldquo;regulations&rdquo; that make night hideous, lead one to
imagine oneself in a third-class hostelry alongside a railway
station.&nbsp; The absence of clocks, too, that strike (for even
they are on the silent system), combined with the primitive hour
of retiring to rest, bewilders one in arriving at anything like
an approximate idea of time between the bell at night and the
bell at 6 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; After my first
interview with Mr. Vaughan, and with the sound of his melodious
voice still ringing <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>in my ears, I found myself about 6 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> alighting from the police van inside
a dismal courtyard.&nbsp; We had just passed through a massive
gate, and had been &ldquo;backed&rdquo; on to the entrance of a
long and uninviting-looking corridor, but beyond that I had not
the faintest idea of where I was; and if I had been told that the
House of Detention was situated in the centre aisle of the
British Museum, I should not have been in a position to dispute
it.&nbsp; As we stepped out, carefully assisted by an official
actuated apparently rather by precaution than courtesy, and
carefully scanned and counted, I found myself with eight or nine
others standing in a row on a huge mat.&nbsp; There was an entire
absence of &ldquo;dressing&rdquo; in this ragged line, and thus
destiny placed me between a ragamuffin with a wooden leg and an
urchin of about twelve.&nbsp; My bulk, sandwiched between them,
formed a charming picture, and filled up the mat, if not the
&ldquo;background.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend, the police sergeant,
with a courtesy that officialism failed to rob him of, handed us
over to the &ldquo;Detentionite&rdquo; barbarian, who, first
inspecting us, and then &ldquo;righting&rdquo; us, went through
the offensive and unnecessary formula of catechizing
us&mdash;such as &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who ga&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>I mean, &ldquo;Your age,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; This to me was the first and greatest
humiliation; the iron entered my very soul, and I realized how
awful it all was.&nbsp; Implacable enemies, vindictive tradesmen,
revengeful women, chuckle and shout; but time is short, and
seventeen days will find me in clover, surrounded by every
consideration that is possible, and as happy as circumstances
will permit.&nbsp; When we had all been counted and booked, we
were escorted downstairs and thrust into very small and separate
cells.&nbsp; These cells were literally not more than three feet
square, and their only furniture consisted of a block of stone
intended for a seat.&nbsp; The turnkey, who showed and carefully
locked me in, explained that I should only be there a few
minutes, as we were merely awaiting the arrival of the chief
warder.&nbsp; After the lapse of a few minutes, we were taken one
by one into the office, where a further scrutiny &ldquo;inside
and out&rdquo; took place.&nbsp; Here, at a desk, sat a warder in
front of a ledger; there was, moreover, a weighing-machine and a
couple of turnkeys.&nbsp; This constituted the entire
furniture!&nbsp; The chief warder, blazing in gold lace and
pegtop trousers that filled me with admiration at the time, now
appeared, and having come <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>to the conclusion that I was not one
of the &ldquo;unwashed&rdquo; division, kindly exempted me from
the usual bath, the preliminary and very necessary step on these
occasions.&nbsp; The chief warder was a very decent and
unaffected little man, and comparatively free from the
penny-halfpenny bounce that characterizes the chief warder
species in general.&nbsp; I here underwent, for the second time,
the catechizing process, which being again carefully booked, I
was invited in the most dulcet tones to unrobe to the extent of
everything except my socks and trousers.&nbsp; With my thoughts
wandering to the weighing-machine, &ldquo;how careful,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;they must be in accurately weighing one;&rdquo;
and my conjecture was in a measure correct, but my inexperience
did not prepare me for the accompanying formula that took
place.&nbsp; As I divested myself one by one of my coat, hat,
boots, vest, shirt, &amp;c., a pair of nimble hands ran over them
with lightning rapidity, which in their turn passed them on to
another pair of equally nimble or nimbler hands.&nbsp; In the
twinkling of an eye, the contents of my pockets were laid on the
table&mdash;the modest quill toothpick was not even exempted;
fingers passed over every seam and lining of my clothes, and then
the same &ldquo;delicate <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>touch&rdquo; was applied to my loins
and ankles.&nbsp; I was then requested to get on the machine, and
the astounding fact recorded that a mountain of humanity in his
shirt and socks weighed 19 stone 13 lbs.&nbsp; I have been
particular in accurately relating this fact, for later on I treat
on the subject of obesity; and the remarks I there make, and the
hints I offer, based on very careful observation and experience,
will, I am confident, commend themselves to the corpulent, and,
<span class="GutSmall">IF ACTED ON</span>, will prove very
beneficial to those who really desire to reduce themselves.&nbsp;
Every article found on me&mdash;money, toothpicks, pocket-book,
watch, studs, sleeve-links, &amp;c.&mdash;were then carefully
booked and neatly tied up, and having resumed my clothing, I
proceeded upstairs to my future abode.</p>
<p>I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without noting the
consideration that prompted the warder to give me a couple of
bone studs to replace my own, without which I could not have kept
my shirt closed.&nbsp; It was a kindly act, and tends to show
that, as a rule and with very few exceptions, prison warders are
a well-disposed race if properly treated, and desirous of
rendering any civility to men of my class.&nbsp; If a prisoner is
fool enough to stand <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>on his dignity, he must not be
surprised if his conduct is resented.&nbsp; Another peculiarity I
observed here for the first time, but which I found to be the
invariable rule at &ldquo;Newgate&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Coldbath,&rdquo; was, that on arrival one was always
placed in a most uncomfortable cell in the basement or even
below, and gradually promoted upwards.&nbsp; I can only suppose
it was intended as a kind of purgatory, with the idea of giving
one a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of what might be expected should
one&rsquo;s behaviour make him ineligible for the greater
luxuries associated with &ldquo;apartments on the drawing-room
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having dressed, I accompanied a turnkey through innumerable
passages abounding in steel gates, which snapped like rat traps
as we passed through, till we emerged into what appeared the main
passage of the prison.&nbsp; My conductor here handed me over to
another warder with a &ldquo;Here you are; here&rsquo;s another
one;&rdquo; and I again, and for the third time, had to undergo
the &ldquo;abridged catechism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found this warder a capital fellow.&nbsp; He tried to put
matters as cheerfully as he could; and when ushering me into my
cell, and noting my horror at <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>its bleak appearance, said in a
manner that was kindly meant, &ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ll be all
right when you&rsquo;ve settled down a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settled down a bit!&rdquo;&nbsp; As well ask the
guinea-pig that is put into the rattlesnake&rsquo;s cage to
settle down, as to expect a man suddenly deprived of liberty to
settle down in such a place.&nbsp; If I had not been of a very
sanguine disposition, and one that can nerve himself to submit to
anything, I should certainly have broken down, as I verily
believe many do.&nbsp; On the contrary, I began to examine the
uncomfortable place, read the notices for one&rsquo;s guidance,
and entered into a conversation with my guide and gaoler.&nbsp;
He began by telling me that if I wanted supper I must order it
sharp; and when I expressed a wish to have something, he kindly
promised to order in a chop and a pint of beer.&nbsp; The next
thing that attracted my attention was the hammock; and as my only
experience of these uncomfortable substitutes for French
bedsteads was from a distant view on a troopship, and as the idea
of 20 stone suspended in mid air was out of the question, and as
the tesselated floor appeared excessively hard, I determined not
to risk a fall, for the fall of that house would certainly <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>have been
great.&nbsp; I discovered, however, that routine and prison
discipline made it absolutely impossible for any exception to be
made unless specially granted, and as none but the highest
official, such as the Governor (or even the Home Secretary, as I
presumed, or perhaps the Queen), could sanction a change of such
importance as substituting a cot for a hammock, no time was to be
lost in ferreting out some one of sufficient authority to assume
the responsibility.&nbsp; At length the doctor was found, and
after seeing me and hearing my weight, gave the necessary order,
subject to the Governor&rsquo;s approval in the morning.</p>
<p>I have often wondered in how many quires of foolscap this
humane act involved the little man.&nbsp; I only hope he got no
wigging from the Home Office for this assumption of
responsibility, for I found him most kind and courteous, and in
return I fear I worried him out of his life by applications for
sleeping draughts, which he invariably let me have without a
murmur.&nbsp; I took this opportunity also of getting his
permission to keep my gas burning all night, for I felt that
sleep was out of the question; and as I had asked for and been
promised the special <i>Standard</i>, which invariably contains
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>some
paragraphs of interest of a world-renowned General&rsquo;s, I
began to hope that I might &ldquo;settle down,&rdquo; as my
friend the warder had suggested.&nbsp; But settling down in
theory and settling down in practice, especially in the
&ldquo;House of Detention,&rdquo; are two distinct things.&nbsp;
The privilege of keeping my gas burning, too, involved a most
unpleasant consequence, diametrically opposed to &ldquo;settling
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anyone whose light is left burning is supposed
to be concocting some hideous treachery, and has to be
&ldquo;seen&rdquo; every fifteen minutes; and thus through this
long dreary winter night and every subsequent ten nights of my
stay found me being taken stock of every quarter of an
hour.&nbsp; I must&mdash;without being aware of it&mdash;about
this time have commenced the &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; process,
for I could actually bring myself to uttering the feeblest jokes,
such as &ldquo;Ah! how are you, old cockie?&nbsp; Just in time;
another minute and I should have burrowed through the
ventilator.&rdquo;&nbsp; These little sallies, I am bound to
admit, did not always meet with the reception their pungency
merited.&nbsp; Occasionally they extracted a grin or a chaffy
reply; at others a grunt and a bang of the trap-door.&nbsp; But I
have again wandered from my first entrance <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>into my cell,
and demonstrating (what I honestly pleaded) my utter
amateurishness in the writing of a book.&nbsp; I must only hope
that the tale it unfolds will make up for this defect.&nbsp; A
rattle of a tin knife on a pewter vessel, followed by the turning
of the key, announced the arrival of my supper; and, oh, shades
of Romano, how &ldquo;my heart beat for thee!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;PRISON FARE.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">greasy</span> cold chop, smelling as if
it had been cooked in &ldquo;Benzine collas,&rdquo; and with
about as much warmth as would be imparted to it by a flat iron, a
slice of bread that had evidently been cut in the early part of
the day, with salt, mustard, a lump of cheese, and a potato piled
up beside it, and a pint of the flattest, blackest, nastiest ale
in a yellow jug without a spout, with my name pasted on it and
the plate, constituted my meal, and nothing but philosophy and a
certain amount of hunger could have induced me to attempt to
tackle it.&nbsp; I did, however, and bolted the food and gulped
down the liquid, and continued the contemplation of my
cell.&nbsp; A few minutes later my warder again appeared with the
&ldquo;special&rdquo; and removed my &ldquo;tray;&rdquo; and the
ringing of the most melancholy-toned bell I had ever heard up to

31</span>me that bed-time had arrived, and I proceeded to turn in
for my first night under lock and key.&nbsp; Believe me, reader,
there is more in this than my words can convey.&nbsp; Writing as
I now am, in a comfortable bed at six in the morning (for my past
experience has instilled very early habits into me), with the
window open, and the sea within a few yards of me, surrounded by
every luxury and comfort that an affectionate mother can think
of, and in a genial climate in the South of France, I cannot even
now look back without a shudder to that fearful first night of
less than a year ago; and the chop and the hammock, and the key
turning, and the &ldquo;settling down&rdquo; appear as vividly
before me as the most hideous nightmare of an hour&rsquo;s
previous occurrence.</p>
<p>At 6 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&mdash;and in November
this means in the pitch dark&mdash;a bell rings; not a heavy
tolling bell, but a shrill, sharp hand bell, wrung with all the
vigour that a prison warder can impart to it.&nbsp; He walks up
and down the long and dreary passages, the noise rising and
falling as he approaches and recedes.&nbsp; I sat up on my pallet
of horsehair, and took it for granted I had better get up.&nbsp;
By the considerate thoughtfulness of our free and enlightened <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Government
every requisite for a (hurried) toilet is here provided,
obviating the very slightest necessity for ever leaving
one&rsquo;s apartments.&nbsp; A tap and diminutive brass basin, a
water-closet (guaranteed, I should say, to produce typhoid in a
marvellously short space of time), a piece of yellow soap the
size of a postage stamp, and a towel of the solidity of the main
sheet of an ironclad, and bearing unmistakable &ldquo;marks of
the beasts&rdquo; that had been my immediate predecessors, were
all at hand, leaving no excuse for the most whimsical for
abstaining from a thorough good (official) wash.&nbsp; I found,
as my experience increased, that the two things most neglected in
Her Majesty&rsquo;s prisons are cleanliness and godliness.&nbsp;
A terrible make-believe distinguishes them both; but if you only
burnish up the outside of the cup and the platter, the inside
may, figuratively speaking, be full of dead men&rsquo;s
bones.&nbsp; I shall adduce very good reasons for these
assertions when time and my destiny have &ldquo;settled me
down&rdquo; in Coldbath Fields.</p>
<p>After a delay of half-an-hour the counting process began,
which consisted of a whole cloud of turnkeys passing rapidly in
front of the various cell doors.&nbsp; A little further delay,
and I was invited <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>to &ldquo;exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went out once and
only once, for as a philosopher one must pocket one&rsquo;s
foolish likes and dislikes, and endeavour to see everything; but
the penance was so fearful that I had a word with the doctor, and
obtained exemption from that date.&nbsp; Conceive, then, a large
and bleak courtyard, flagged and partially gravelled, bounded on
three sides by the prison walls, and on the fourth by high
railings and a still higher wall beyond it; conceive, too, a
couple of hundred of the scum of London, the halt and the lame,
the black chutnee seller and the mendicant newsvendor, with here
and there some unfortunate devil like myself in the garb of a
gentleman; add to this a warder standing on a pedestal at each
corner, and another roaming round in the centre, and then cap
this awful picture by watching this frowsy tag-rag mass walking
round in a circle about a yard apart, and you may possibly form
some slight notion of my feelings.&nbsp; When I got to the outer
door that led into the yard, I hesitated for a moment, and I told
a warder that I really did not think I could face the ordeal; but
he advised me, in what was kindly meant, to have a try, and that
if I walked round no one would take a bit of notice of me.&nbsp;
I found this assurance <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>was hardly strictly correct, for my
huge size and evident superiority (in clothes if not in morals)
drew notice on me; and many a scoundrel as he limped by asked me,
in a gin-and-water voice, what I was &ldquo;in for,&rdquo; and
whether it was the &ldquo;first&rdquo; time.&nbsp; I, however,
ignored their delicate overtures towards sociability, and longed
for daylight and its accompanying breakfast.&nbsp; The
hour&rsquo;s exercise eventually passed by, and I returned to my
den, where shortly afterwards my breakfast appeared.&nbsp; This
came from the eating-house over the way, and a nastier, colder,
or more revolting conglomeration of roll sliced and buttered, a
fried egg, and a piece of bacon that must have spent the night in
a rat-trap, and a pint of chicory in a yellow jug, I never
saw.&nbsp; I ventured to draw the warder&rsquo;s attention to the
proximity that existed between these various delicacies, but he
explained that mine was only one of some seventy other breakfasts
of &ldquo;privileged&rdquo; prisoners, and that they had been in
the passage for over an hour.&nbsp; Assuming, therefore, that my
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner</i> had probably been sandwiched between
a burglar&rsquo;s tripe and onions and some other brother
malefactor&rsquo;s tea and shrimps, I held my breath and
&ldquo;laid on,&rdquo; and was surprised what a hole I had <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>made in all
the good things in an incredibly short period.&nbsp; But time
(especially in Houses of Detention) waits for no man, and in a
twinkling my breakfast things were removed, and a bell summoned
us to chapel.&nbsp; I now found myself in church, and after a ten
minutes&rsquo; farce, which embraced every modern religious
improvement&mdash;such as singing, a sermon, and a chaplain in a
white surplice&mdash;we were again escorted back, and awaited the
visit of the Governor.</p>
<p>The chaplain at the &ldquo;House of Detention&rdquo; was, I
should say, rather a good sort; he and I had frequent
conversations, and as he was the man who had once put a spoke
into Bignell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Argyll&rdquo; wheel, and as I was the
humble instrument that had &ldquo;smashed, defeated, and utterly
pulverized&rdquo; Barnabas Amos and his night-house, a bond of
mutual interest at once sprang up between us as enemies of
immorality in general, and Bignell and Amos in particular.&nbsp;
This reverend gentleman was, I should say, decidedly High Church;
he wore all day (and for aught I know all night) a black
skull-cap and gown, and possessing an enormous red beard, that
came down to his waist, he invariably inspired me with much the
same <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>amount and sort of reverence that I entertain when
contemplating stained-glass likenesses of Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John.&nbsp; His manner at first was a little pompous,
especially when he was telling me of the sort of books he would
permit and not permit me to order in; he was, however, despite
these peculiarities, unmistakably a gentleman, both in manner and
appearance&mdash;two qualifications I subsequently discovered
were sadly deficient in more than one of his species.&nbsp; And
now the door was opened with a terrific bang, and I was told by a
turnkey with bated breath and evidently suffering from excessive
mental excitement, that &ldquo;the Governor&rdquo; was coming
round, and before I had time to shake myself together, and rise
to receive him, the great man was in my cell.&nbsp; Captain
&mdash; was the beau ideal of a plunger, and had served many
years in the K.D.G.&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He eventually exchanged from
soldiering to &ldquo;prisoning,&rdquo; and had served his time as
&ldquo;Deputy&rdquo; of Exeter and Cold Bath Fields
prisons.&nbsp; I was told at this latter retreat that he was in
those days excessively zealous in the matter of dust, and that
his great height enabled him to extract infinitesimal atoms of
this irrepressible commodity from shelves and <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>ventilators
that men more of the &ldquo;Zach&aelig;us&rdquo; type would never
have noticed.&nbsp; Like most men, however, time had blunted his
zeal for these trifles, and when I saw him he had grown out of
these absurdities of his novitiate, and appeared as one who had
an unpleasant duty to perform, and who was anxious to do it as
pleasantly as possible.&nbsp; He accosted me as one might expect
a gentleman would, and asked me if there was anything he could do
to ameliorate my condition?&nbsp; I mentioned certain things, and
he at once gave the necessary orders for my being permitted
newspapers, pen, ink, and paper, my gas at night, and exemption
from chapel and exercise.&nbsp; All this brought it to near
twelve o&rsquo;clock, when dinners commenced being
&ldquo;served;&rdquo; and without detailing all the horrors I
ate, suffice it to say that another plateful of offal, such as a
hy&aelig;na would jib at, duly made its appearance, and was as
duly demolished, more or less.&nbsp; The first day in this
terrible place is perhaps more awful than any subsequent one;
for, irrespective of the novelty of the situation and not having
&ldquo;settled down,&rdquo; it must be taken into consideration
that one has barely had time to communicate with friends and
solicitors, and thus the <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>day passes wearily away, affording
ample time for reflection and the realisation of the fact that
one may be in the heart of London and yet as far away from
friends and relatives as if in the middle of the Desert of
Sahara.&nbsp; The above sketch will pretty accurately convey an
idea of a day&rsquo;s routine in the House of Detention,
excepting perhaps a visit from a friend daily, a restriction that
is as iniquitous as it is illogical, and which I trust the
authorities will consider worthy of alteration.&nbsp; Visits from
solicitors constitute another feature of this existence.&nbsp;
Visits from friends are made as uncomfortable as can well be
conceived; the drop window in the cell door, 12 inches by 8, and
carefully covered with zinc netting, is opened, and with the
visitor on the one side in the cold and dark passage, and the
prisoner on the other in his cell, it is really difficult to hear
all that is said, for the echo and shouting that is going on
throughout requires a very practised ear to catch the muffled
sounds.&nbsp; If any reader has ever put his head into a sack
(which I haven&rsquo;t) and tried to talk, or heard the ghost
speak at a transpontine theatre, some idea of the extraordinary
hollow change in the voice may be imagined.&nbsp; A more <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>inconsiderate
system could hardly be adopted, and absolutely debars respectable
persons from submitting to the ordeal entailed by such
visits.&nbsp; The visits of solicitors are, however, far better
managed, and permitted with a degree of comfort that quite
surprised me.&nbsp; A private room is placed at your disposal,
where you can say (and, as I found, do) pretty much what you
please without let or hindrance; and beyond having a badge
temporarily placed on your arm to indicate the number of your
cell, and having the door carefully locked, you might fancy
yourself having a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> on a
rainy day in the second class refreshment-room of the Crystal
Palace.&nbsp; Only two unusual circumstances occurred to vary the
monotony of my daily life; the one was the being served with a
writ by a foolish tailor in Pall Mall, or rather his executors,
for poor old Morris had long since paid the penalty of affluence
and good feeding.&nbsp; That any men of the world, such as I
supposed them to be, should have lent themselves to anything so
childish as to serve a man with a &ldquo;writ&rdquo; who was
awaiting his trial on a charge that might involve a seclusion
&ldquo;for years or may be for ever&rdquo; passes my
comprehension.&nbsp; I often felt I owed an apology to the <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>unhappy
deputy of these irrepressible snips, for he must have found it
cold and very miserable whilst awaiting my arrival in that
cheerless corridor, and I registered a vow, when the opportunity
occurred, to express my regret for the scant comfort and apparent
want of courtesy he received at my hands; but I was the victim of
cruel circumstances over which I had no control.&nbsp; Another
event that intruded itself on the even tenor of my ways was a
letter from &ldquo;Georgina&rdquo;; and as the narration will
involve a certain essential digression to make matters clear, I
must again ask the reader&rsquo;s indulgence.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GEORGINA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> has not heard of
Georgina?&nbsp; Ask Gounod, ask Monsieur Riviere, ask Mr.
Vaughan, ask me, ask yourself, indulgent reader.&nbsp; I made
this lady&rsquo;s acquaintance some five years ago, about eleven
<span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, outside Covent Garden
Theatre, when she was apparently being supported by her seconds
and spongeholders, after her third or fourth round (I forget
which) with the &ldquo;Leicester Square Pet&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Regent Street Chicken,&rdquo; or both.&nbsp; I was not an
eye-witness of this revival of the good old days of the ring, so
my statement as to details must not be implicitly accepted.&nbsp;
I, however, made one of an excited and surging mob, and gleaned
that the cause was the fair Georgina, who had lately been
&ldquo;removed&rdquo; from inside the theatre.&nbsp; In a
thoughtless moment, and with an eye to business, and with the
hope of turning an honest penny by taking <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>this amiable
creature into the provinces (for I dabbled in things theatrical
in those days) I entered into conversation with one of her
satellites, which ripened into an intimacy of the most deplorable
and expensive nature, and ended in the climax that procured me a
most abusive and threatening letter whilst in the House of
Detention, and subsequently a visit from her on my second
appearance at Bow-street, where she occupied a prominent position
in the front row.&nbsp; Immediately, then, after this
lady&rsquo;s notoriety connected with the above
<i>contretemps</i>, it struck me that she could not fail to
&ldquo;draw&rdquo; in the provinces, if not on her merits as a
vocalist, at least on account of her other amiable
accomplishments.&nbsp; A series of visits to her residence ended
in my securing the professional services of this inestimable
treasure; and though the terms and conditions with which she
hampered her agreement to accompany me on a six weeks&rsquo; tour
were sufficient to have made a more experienced man hesitate, I
at length consented to all she proposed, and our agreement was
virtually completed.&nbsp; Georgina is, I should say, an
implacable foe; she is also, I should fancy, a good friend until
a row&mdash;an inevitable <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>consequence&mdash;takes place.&nbsp;
This latter characteristic showed itself on this occasion; she
made it a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>, and refused to budge an inch
unless I agreed to permit her to be accompanied by a huge French
woman whom she called her companion, and a sickly youth whom she
designated her secretary.&nbsp; I was not only to cart this
worthy couple about first-class, but to pay for their board and
lodgings.&nbsp; As the French person was as voracious as a
cormorant, and as the secretary was apparently suffering from
some complaint that impelled him to eat inordinately three or
four times a day, and as provincial hotels are proverbially
expensive when the ordinary routine is in the least deviated
from, and as nothing but the best and most
<i>r&eacute;cherch&eacute; menu</i> was considered good enough
for this worthy trio, my bill and my feelings after a three
days&rsquo; experience may be easier imagined than described;
added to all this, Georgina&rsquo;s delicate health precluded her
from abstaining from food for any length of time, and thus when
we journeyed from one town to another a hamper of prog had to be
invariably made up for sustaining nature in the transit.&nbsp;
Good heavens! such appetites would have eaten one out of house
and home, <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>even if any profits had been made; but when the takings
were absolutely &ldquo;nil,&rdquo; and the working expenses about
&pound;100 a week, it will not surprise the reader to learn that
I lost &pound;400 in less than a fortnight, and returned to
London a sadder and a wiser man.&nbsp; I cannot omit one absurd
feature in this &ldquo;starring&rdquo; tour which occurred in a
town very far north, and which happily brought my disastrous tour
to an abrupt and unexpected conclusion.&nbsp; The hour that the
concert was to commence was eight; the audience had been
respectfully solicited to be in their places by that hour&mdash;a
request, I am bound to admit, the entire audience present
considerately complied with&mdash;everything, in short, was done
by visiting, puffing, advertising, and personally canvassing,
that ingenuity and activity on my part could suggest; and at a
quarter before eight I awaited behind the curtain (seeing, but
unseen), with throbbing heart, the arrival of the vast crowds
that I confidently expected.&nbsp; The fair and amiable one was
seated on a fauteuil, radiant with smiles, and attired in a
matchless robe of white water silk and ruffles&mdash;a kind of
mixture between the &ldquo;Marie Antoinette&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Gorgonzola&rdquo; styles, or what the cross would be, if
such styles do or ever have <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>existed&mdash;(should any lady read
this description she will, I trust, pardon any imperfections of
detail.)</p>
<p>The female cormorant was administering some light stimulant,
for Georgina is subject to fits of nervousness, incredible as
this may appear.&nbsp; The emaciated one was in front assisting
in looking after the money-taker; and I feel thankful to
Providence on his account, if not on my own, that this was far
from an arduous task, for the poor fellow was evidently delicate
and physically incapable of lifting a heavy cash-box, and so,
with all my faults, blood-guiltiness cannot be laid to my
charge.&nbsp; Time meanwhile was rapidly passing, and a huge
clock pointed to three minutes to eight, then two minutes, then
one, and then eight o&rsquo;clock struck, and, oh horror of
horrors! the <i>sole</i> occupant of the enormous building was
the critic of the local paper.&nbsp; Decency forbade our opening
the concert to this solitary unhappy man; it appeared to me to be
cowardly to attack him alone, and to pit him single-handed
against the invincible Georgina, who had demolished a conductor
and his manager a week previously, and who now showed symptoms of
&ldquo;annoyance&rdquo; that nothing but my soothing powers
prevented bursting into a flame.&nbsp; My plan of action <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>was
immediately taken; to hesitate a moment was to be lost.&nbsp; I
at once sent for the &ldquo;secretary,&rdquo; and first thought
of telling him to make a short speech from the stage to our
solitary audience; but reflection decided me in approaching him
myself.&nbsp; I apologised for the unusual occurrence (it had in
reality happened wherever we had been, though not to the extent
of less than seven or eight); I offered to return him his money,
for I was well aware his was a complimentary ticket, and verily
believe that the united purses of the entire company could not
have scraped together five shillings.&nbsp; He muttered something
I tried not to hear, and next day repaid my intended courtesy by
a flaming smashing article that would effectually have ruined us
had we moved elsewhere.&nbsp; But events were occurring at the
same time which put it out of my power to continue this
disastrous tour.&nbsp; About eleven o&rsquo;clock the landlord of
the hotel presented himself at my room, said the lady and her
friends had left, and politely but firmly intimated that he could
not permit me to remove my luggage till a little bill of &pound;8
was settled.&nbsp; The rest is soon told.&nbsp; I hurried back to
London, remitted the &pound;8, and abandoned the tour.&nbsp; I
had not, however, heard the <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>last of my musical <i>b&ecirc;te
noire</i>; she and the &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; both dunned me for
their railway fares, which I of course ignored, and I heard no
more of her till she dug me out at the House of Detention, when
she threatened me with legal proceedings for detaining, as she
alleged, her photographs&mdash;the real fact being that, after
our last stampede, her photographs that were displayed were
seized by some indignant creditor in expectation of a
ransom.&nbsp; For my part I hope I have really heard the last of
this irrepressible creature.</p>
<h2><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BOW STREET.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> eventful day was now
approaching, and on the morrow I was to appear at Bow Street for
the first time after my formal remand of the previous
Friday.&nbsp; I felt an instinctive conviction that my appearance
(even though it had not appeared up to that time in the
newspapers) would be generally known, and draw together a crowd
actuated by motives either of like, dislike, or curiosity; nor
was I wrong in my surmise.&nbsp; An official at the police court
informed me that numbers of inquiries had been made as to the
time of my probable appearance; and as the appointed hour drew
near fresh arrivals and those that had been waiting since 10
<span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> combined in making up a crowd
that literally crammed the court.&nbsp; It was, I admit, a very
trying ordeal, for I had been pretty accurately informed what
persons were in the court and <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>waiting to see the
&ldquo;fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did, however, the best (though, I
fear, a very foolish) thing under the circumstances, and primed
myself with liquor, which certain friends, by dint of great
ingenuity, managed to convey to me, for the gaoler, though a most
civil and obliging man, was a terrible disciplinarian, and one
that was not to be &ldquo;squared.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had I not taken
these repeated nips&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid to say how much I
imbibed&mdash;I firmly believe I could never have gone through
the examination with the <i>sang froid</i> I displayed.</p>
<p>About 12 o&rsquo;clock a hurrying of feet approaching my cell
announced to me that my turn was come; and after a momentary
pause in the passage I found myself escorted by a constable and
in the dock.&nbsp; I can never forget that terrible moment.&nbsp;
In front, on each side, and behind me was a dense throng,
representing every class of persons I had ever had dealings
with.&nbsp; One expected a certain amount of hostility from the
side of the prosecution, but the array of faces I then saw opened
up in me a new train of thoughts.&nbsp; Here was a room thronged
with people I had befriended and people I had never injured; men
I had stood dinners to when their funds were lower than mine; <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>lodging-house
keepers that had fleeced me, and waiters I had tipped beyond
their deserts; nameless attorneys from the slums of the City,
courting daylight and publicity in the hopeless endeavour to get
their names into print by the gratuitous offer of their valuable
but hitherto unappreciated services&mdash;all craning their necks
to stare at and exult over a poor devil, who, whatever his
faults, was now at a disadvantage.&nbsp; It was the old adage of
&ldquo;hitting a man when he is down;&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m
thankful for the experience that has enabled me to form a just
estimate of the worthlessness of such professions of
friendship.&nbsp; On the other hand, I heard of many
persons&mdash;to their honour, be it said&mdash;who abstained
from being present through feelings of generous
consideration.&nbsp; My <i>quasi</i>-friend Georgina occupied a
conspicuous place in the front row.&nbsp; I verily believe she
never took her eyes off me, but her offensive stare had no charm
for me; I had more serious matters to occupy my mind.&nbsp; A
mountain of flesh that I was once on terms of intimacy with was
also present, panting with excitement, but, like the Levite of
old, &ldquo;he passed over on the other side.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will
not weary the reader with details that repeat themselves almost
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>daily in
the police reports; suffice it to say that I was again remanded
for another week, and then formally committed for trial at the
next sessions of the Central Criminal Court.</p>
<p>On my two previous remands to the House of Detention I had
always managed to remain at Bow Street till the 5 o&rsquo;clock
van took its load of victims.&nbsp; It was, at all events, a
change, and infinitely more agreeable than the depressing
atmosphere of Clerkenwell.&nbsp; On the day, however, of my
committal to Newgate I was informed that I could not, as before,
wait till 5 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, but must be ready
to start at 2.&nbsp; The rope was clearly getting
&ldquo;tauter&rdquo;; discipline was gradually assuming its sway,
the circles around me smaller and smaller.&nbsp; The other
occupants of the &ldquo;Black Maria&rdquo; were, like myself, all
committed for trial; and as we drove along I was much surprised
at the marvellous knowledge they appeared to have gained of me
and my affairs.&nbsp; I was, as before, standing in the passage
and not in a compartment, and consequently could hear all that
passed between the various passengers.&nbsp; My case was the sole
subject of conversation; occasionally I was the object of a
little mirthful sally.&nbsp; Thus, a man who had been <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>sentenced to
three months&rsquo; imprisonment in default of paying a fine,
said, &ldquo;Ah, Capting, you might give us two of them quids to
pay my fine&rdquo;&mdash;referring to some money that had been
alluded to in the court as having been in my possession at the
time of my arrest.&nbsp; Another hinted that I &ldquo;Best take a
good look at the streets, &rsquo;cos all wud be changed like
afore I cum out agin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another assured me that the
warm baths in Newgate &ldquo;wus fine but &rsquo;ot.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A lady, too, graced our party; she was tawdry, I admit, and lived
in the Dials.&nbsp; Her misfortune was that she had mistaken
someone&rsquo;s purse for her own.&nbsp; She was howling over her
ill-luck for the first part of the journey, but before we arrived
at our destination had quite recovered her usual spirits.&nbsp;
She told me she was an actress&mdash;an assertion I am not in a
position to dispute, though I found her conversation quite as
intellectual as that of the usual ballet-girl class; and as she
was the last &ldquo;lady&rdquo; I was likely to see or hear for
some time, I paid great respect to her conversation.&nbsp; All
these familiarities were terribly grating to me; they were more
difficult to bear than any of my previous humiliations.&nbsp;
They were, as it were, the first instalments of being addressed
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as an
equal by inferiors who had hitherto recognised me as a superior;
and as we drove along, past objects as familiar to me as my own
face, I felt the lump rising in my throat, and I dread to think
what weakness I might have been guilty of had not a sharp turn
brought us in front of Newgate, and the opening of a huge gate on
its creaking hinges recalled me to a sense of my unenviable
position.&nbsp; The van, having crossed the courtyard, was backed
against the door, where a string of warders formally received us;
and after again submitting to the painful ordeal of being
catechized, I found myself traversing a dismal and nearly dark
corridor; and then the hideous conviction forced itself on me for
the first time that I was actually a prisoner and securely lodged
in Newgate.</p>
<h2><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEWGATE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much has been written about this
national Bastille, and so many have gone over the building, that
one feels as if writing about &ldquo;a tale that is
told.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I trust my narrative may
describe things never before alluded to, and be found to contain
matters of interest that came under my personal
observation.&nbsp; The first thing at Newgate that a fresh
arrival has to submit to is the indispensable bath, accompanied
by a very minute and simultaneous search.&nbsp; I was at once
ushered downstairs and into a very roomy and luxurious bath room,
quite as good as any supplied for eighteenpence at West End
establishments, and being invited to undress and get into the
bath, had the gratification of observing my clothes undergo, one
by one, a very thorough overhauling.&nbsp; Each item was
severally manipulated, and I am <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>convinced not a pin could have
escaped detection.&nbsp; Meanwhile I was splashing and thoroughly
enjoying myself, much as one has seen a duck that has been cooped
up for a week when suddenly turned into a pond.&nbsp; I had not
had such a revel for ten days, and in the ecstasy of the moment I
felt as if it was almost worth the journey to Newgate for such a
luxury.&nbsp; This periodical bath is one of the greatest
&ldquo;inflictions&rdquo; the average prisoner has to submit to,
and numerous instances came under my observation at a later
period, of ingenuity displayed by frowzy malefactors to evade
this regulation.&nbsp; Twenty minutes found me again
&ldquo;clothed and in my right mind,&rdquo; and I was ushered
into a cell on the same subterraneous floor.&nbsp; This cell was
certainly the most empty I had ever seen; its entire furniture
literally consisted of a camp stool and a thermometer, and this
latter instrument caused me considerable annoyance, for I am not
exaggerating when I assert that an absurd make-believe display of
anxiety for one&rsquo;s welfare involved a visit and calculation
of the temperature every half-hour through the night.&nbsp; I
utterly failed to fathom this custom, the more so as the turnkey
who made the calculation probably <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>understood as much about it as he did
of astronomy, and can only attribute it to the inherent
politeness developed in the officials who periodically have
lodgers whom they begin by feeding up, and eventually end by
launching into eternity with a hand shake, if we are to believe
the papers.&nbsp; This idea is not my own, but was suggested to
me by a terrible scamp and fellow lodger whom I shall presently
introduce to the reader.&nbsp; An absurd habit that prevailed at
Newgate, and which contrasted strangely with the other customs,
was that of the chief warder as he finally counted us at
night.&nbsp; This official, having glared at you with an
expression such as the rattlesnake may be presumed to give the
guinea-pig just before dinner, invariably said &ldquo;Good
night!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was so struck by this unique and
time-honoured custom that I asked my friend and valet&mdash;for
he cleaned out my cell and did other jobs for me&mdash;Mr. Mike
Rose what it meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;they gets into a sort of perlite way like, &rsquo;cos
whenever a cove swings they nigh allus shakes hands with
&rsquo;im, and maybe this is &rsquo;ow they gits perlite
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was something so original in this logic
that I could not but be impressed by it, and though I failed to
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>discover
the connection between the two circumstances, still I had
realized that Mr. Mike Rose was a bit of a character and worth
cultivation.&nbsp; Very shortly after my incarceration in the
thermometer-furnished cell I was visited by the surgeon, and
having obtained his permission to have a bed instead of a
hammock, a wooden tressel was brought in with sheets, bolster,
and blankets.&nbsp; I at once proceeded to make my couch, deeming
bed the best place on such a cold and cheerless afternoon; and 6
o&rsquo;clock <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> found me in bed,
vainly endeavouring to get warm, with my eye fixed on the
thermometer, and muffled up to the chin with sheets and blankets,
all of which were stamped in letters three inches long with the
ominous words &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Newgate
Prison</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I really believed that my first
night&rsquo;s experience at the &ldquo;House of Detention&rdquo;
was sufficiently awful, but it was nothing to my sensations
here.&nbsp; The associations of the place, the idea that many a
murderer had probably occupied this very cell, and possibly slept
in these identical bed-coverings, all forced themselves upon
me.&nbsp; The bells of the numerous churches which abound round
Newgate also seemed desirous of adding to one&rsquo;s misery by
joyful peals; they were <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>practising their weekly bell-ringing,
and one chime was repeating over and over again&mdash;in mockery
of me, as it were&mdash;Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hymn of the
Creation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Heavens are telling&rdquo; kept
floating into my ears through granite walls and iron bars; and
though I tried very hard to stifle sound by burying myself under
the &ldquo;broad-arrowed&rdquo; bed-clothing, all my efforts were
futile, till sleep, kind sleep, took pity on me, and I wandered
in my dreams far away from my dreadful abode, only to be recalled
to the hideous reality by the mournful prison bell,
and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sorrow returned with the light of the
morn,<br />
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The daily routine is somewhat different to that of the
&ldquo;House of Detention.&rdquo;&nbsp; One official only counts
the prisoners of a morning, and asks you at the time if you wish
to see the doctor during the day.&nbsp; I was once tempted to
express this wish with a view of procuring a sleeping
draught.&nbsp; He questioned me as to my symptoms in an
apparently interested manner, and eventually ordered me a dose of
&ldquo;No. 2.&rdquo;&nbsp; No. 2, I may here state, is a
ready-made article, and is baled out of a huge jar into a dirty
tin cup.&nbsp; I took my dose, and, without further detailing the
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>result, am
extremely grateful I had not been prescribed No. 1.&nbsp; If I
had, it is very doubtful whether this narrative would ever have
been written.&nbsp; The first day is occupied with details to
which considerable importance appear to be attached&mdash;namely,
your description&mdash;every particular of which is carefully
booked by the head of each department, and a more senseless,
harassing ordeal can hardly be conceived.&nbsp; Surely one
inspection and general description (this was my third within ten
days) ought to suffice, and might without much trouble be
forwarded from one prison to another.&nbsp; It is idle to deny
that half the questions put to you are absolutely unnecessary,
and the conviction is forced on you that you are being pumped
from sheer curiosity.&nbsp; Thus the Chaplain, in the blandest
manner, only to be acquired by constant attendance on murderers
previous to execution, asked me questions that appeared most
impertinent&mdash;as to where I lived, and if I had any
relatives, and where they lived.&nbsp; I at once told him I
considered all this quite unnecessary, and declined to enlighten
him.&nbsp; Immediately after breakfast on the first morning the
prisoners are taken in packs of about twenty before the
Governor.&nbsp; This man is what is known in the army as <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a
&ldquo;Ranker&rdquo;&mdash;that is, one who by merit has raised
himself from the rank and file to his present position&mdash;and
had apparently brought with him many of those habits which,
however commendable in a turnkey, are beneath the dignity of a
Governor and lower the position he ought to occupy.&nbsp; Acting
on the habits associated with his youth, this Governor commenced
a minute examination of one&rsquo;s physiognomy.&nbsp; Seizing
you by the nose or ear (I forget which), and scowling hard, he
began, &ldquo;Eyes grey, complexion fresh, mole on neck,
&amp;c.;&rdquo; and having further personally superintended your
being measured and weighed, you were filtered through, as it
were, into the presence of the Chaplain, who tried to pump you as
before described, and who, in his turn, passed you on to the
doctor, who appeared to have a kind of roving commission to
endeavour to extract any crumbs of information omitted by his two
<i>confr&egrave;res</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The whole style and system at Newgate was excessively
low.&nbsp; I was moreover very much struck by the resemblance
that appeared to exist between the officials from the highest to
the lowest.&nbsp; Every one had the same unpleasant expression
that suggested the idea that they lived in gloomy streets, where
the drainage <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>was bad.&nbsp; I attribute this in a measure to a
commendable desire on the part of the subordinates to imitate
their chief, who had not a pleasant expression, and shows how
necessary it is that Government should select a gentleman by
birth and manners&mdash;irrespective of every other
recommendation&mdash;for a position of such delicacy as that of a
prison Governor.&nbsp; The next ordeal one had to submit to was
&ldquo;Chapel,&rdquo; and, barring the novelty of the scene, I
can hardly conceive a more absurd farce.&nbsp; The pumping
Chaplain was here metamorphosed into the surpliced cleric, and it
is difficult to decide in which character he was most
objectionable.&nbsp; In justice I must commend him for the
brevity of his remarks, for from find to finish&mdash;from
&ldquo;When the wicked man&rdquo; to the end of the
sermon&mdash;was all compressed into fifteen minutes, and away we
again trudged, like Alice in Wonderland, in search of further
novelty.&nbsp; The Chapel of Newgate is a very awful place;
anything more calculated to banish reverential feeling and
inspire horror can hardly be conceived.&nbsp; On each side is a
huge cage, different from anything I had ever seen, except,
perhaps, the elephant house at the Zoological.&nbsp; In these,
prisoners convicted and prisoners awaiting <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>trial are
severally placed, thus effectually dividing the Scotland Yard
sheep from the Scotland Yard goats.&nbsp; Above, protected by
small red curtains, were diminutive balconies, capable of holding
three persons at most; these were for the accommodation of
murderers, from whence they receive the consolations of religion
(official) whilst awaiting strangulation.&nbsp; The vibration of
a curtain led me to the conclusion that one of these mortuaries
was daily occupied, a suspicion that was confirmed by events
which I subsequently heard and saw.&nbsp; I discovered, indeed,
that a gentleman who had cut the throats of half his family, and
who eventually benefited by the religious consolation of the
Chaplain and the delicate attentions of Mr. Marwood, was a
fellow-lodger at the same time as myself.&nbsp; I saw the poor
wretch every day passing and repassing, and later on
&ldquo;assisted&rdquo; at certain preliminaries in his
honour.&nbsp; I moreover had a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of his last
appearance in public, facts that I shall duly narrate
hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exercise&rdquo; was an indispensable feature of life in
Newgate, and nothing, I believe, could have exempted one from
this ordeal.&nbsp; It answered, indeed, more purposes than
one.&nbsp; Health was <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>doubtless essential; identification,
however, was considerably more important.&nbsp; Three times a
week, and before starting on our circus-like walk, all the
prisoners awaiting trial, amounting to over two hundred, were
ranged shoulder to shoulder round the walls, a preliminary that
at first puzzled me considerably.&nbsp; I was not, however, left
long in ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>A little way off, and apparently approaching, I heard the
measured tramp of an advancing crowd, and suddenly there appeared
a long string of men in single file; these were the detectives,
some seventy or eighty in number, bent on a mission of
recognition.&nbsp; Slowly they passed before us, each one staring
and occasionally stopping and addressing a prisoner, or
whispering to one of their companions.&nbsp; These preliminary
enquiries often led to minuter inspections; and if they expressed
the wish, a prisoner was afterwards honoured by a private view,
and carefully compared with photographs and police
descriptions.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is a very essential
proceeding, and many a man &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for an
undiscovered crime in another part of the kingdom, and committed
months or years previously, is recognized by this salutary
custom.&nbsp; As may be supposed, this inspection had <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>absolutely no
personal interest to me.&nbsp; Still the ordeal, degrading in the
extreme, never failed to inspire me with horror; and I dreaded
the mornings when the &ldquo;detecs,&rdquo; as they were lovingly
termed, made their appearance.&nbsp; There was something so weird
and uncanny in the whole thing&mdash;the distant tramp, the
solemn march past, the offensive leer, the familiar stare, all
combined to make a horrible impression.&nbsp; A more repulsive
body of men than these &ldquo;detecs&rdquo; can hardly be
conceived, got up as they were in every kind of costume&mdash;men
in pot hats and slap-bang coats, others in shabby-genteel frock
coats and tall hats; some in fustians and others in waterproofs
and leggings, but all with the same unmistakable
expression.&nbsp; I hope the authorities are not under the
impression that these individuals are unknown to the law-breaking
community, for no greater fallacy can possibly exist.&nbsp; I
never missed an opportunity hereafter of asking habitual
criminals this question, and am satisfied that their appearances,
their beats, and their daily routine are known to every habitual
criminal in London.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll prove this hereafter.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, one has only to look about in the streets, and he
cannot fail to observe a civilian <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>frequently talking to a
policeman.&nbsp; This man is not asking his way, but is in
nineteen cases out of twenty a &ldquo;recogniser&rdquo;; nor can
it be wondered at if their foolish actions and evident
unwillingness to conceal their vocation makes them as
distinguishable as they are.&nbsp; I will confidently assert that
every pickpocket and every &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; knows each
and every one of these detectives; and as they invariably
frequent the same beat, and pursue the same tactics at the same
time every day, it can hardly be wondered at.&nbsp; I
know&mdash;and it will hardly be asserted that I could know it
except by having heard it from others&mdash;that a detective is
&ldquo;due&rdquo; daily at King&rsquo;s Cross Metropolitan
Station about two <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, and remains
about an hour, and that on race-days he is there before the
return from the meeting.&nbsp; If this is true&mdash;as I believe
it to be&mdash;it is natural to suppose that other facts are
equally well known.&nbsp; I could adduce a hundred instances of
this sort, for I made burglars my particular study, and will
disclose hereafter my ideas of the many fallacies that at present
exist on this subject, and the causes that lead to burglaries,
and how they are easiest avoided.&nbsp; I never lost the
opportunity of questioning a burglar or a <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>pickpocket,
and during the next few months I saw some very fair specimens of
these respective species.&nbsp; My remarks must not be taken as
referring to the higher Scotland-yard detectives, than whom no
cleverer body exists, but to these trumpery plainclothes men, or
&ldquo;recognisers,&rdquo; that may be seen at every corner, and
who, I verily believe, do more to impede than further
justice.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SCAFFOLD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the corner of the yard where I
daily exercised stood an unpretending looking shed, with slate
roof and large folding doors, and resembling a coach-house more
than anything I can compare it to.&nbsp; This building always
puzzled me, and I enquired of my friend and fellow-lodger, Mr.
Mike Rose, what it was.&nbsp; I then discovered it was the
scaffold, that grim limb of the law on which so many wretches
have periodically suffered within three weeks of their sentence
at the Old Bailey Sessions, or, as they are familiarly known,
&ldquo;The C. C. C.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was most anxious to have a
minute examination of this masterpiece of Marwood&rsquo;s, for it
is admitted that that eminent manipulator of the carotid artery
has brought his genius to bear on the grim subject with such
success that drop, knot, and platform have all arrived at the
highest <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>possible degree of perfection.&nbsp; It was the custom
to utilise the services of certain prisoners every day in general
cleaning and helping about the prison, and as I was convinced
that &ldquo;the scaffold&rdquo; would, like every other prison
institution, require a periodical clean up, I suggested to my
turnkey that if the chance occurred he should select me to assist
in this cheerful and instructive duty.&nbsp; He laughed at the
idea of <i>my</i> doing such work, and added that they only
selected men whose antecedents had habituated them to scrubbing
and cleaning; but I explained to him that if Mike and I were
selected, that Mike would do all the washing, and that I would
exercise a sort of moral effect and general supervision that
could not possibly make the slightest difference to him, and was
based on an agreement between Mike and myself, whereby for a
consideration of bread and butter, and my leavings generally, he
was to clean out my cell daily and make himself useful to me, and
on my behalf.&nbsp; This warder was a very good
sort&mdash;indeed, about the only one that had not that offensive
&ldquo;bad drainage&rdquo; expression I had noticed in the
others.&nbsp; So he promised compliance, and one day after dinner
I found myself in company <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>with Mike, crossing the yard&mdash;I
with a duster and he with a mop and pail <i>en route</i> to the
scaffold.&nbsp; There is something horrible in this idea, and
many readers will probably consider my act and desire to
participate in such a task as in the worst possible taste, but I
felt I should <i>never</i> have such a chance again, and being,
moreover, a philosopher, and actuated, even at that early stage,
with a determination of some day writing my experiences, I lost
no opportunity from the first day of my incarceration to the last
to see <i>everything</i> by hook or by crook.&nbsp; I can fairly
say I attained my object, and saw <i>more</i> than any other man
has ever done before, and that too under such favourable
circumstances as something more than chance enabled me to.&nbsp;
It may not here be out of place to say that I have read every
book, sensational or realistic, that purports to describe prison
life, and have invariably come to the conclusion that the writers
never really wrote from personal observation, or, if they did,
had failed signally in giving a correct description of what
actually exists.&nbsp; Many were well-written books, but they
were <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> prison life.&nbsp; This
narrative (to use an advertising phrase) supplies a want long <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>felt, and if
it abounds with faults of composition&mdash;as I readily confess
it does&mdash;it compensates in a measure for its shortcomings by
the accuracy of its details.&nbsp; It is written in a vein,
moreover, more likely&mdash;as I hope&mdash;to meet public
approval than that snivelling, sanctimonious style adopted by its
predecessors, and which, even if sincere, would nevertheless be
palling, but where indulged in by some scheming, anonymous,
rascally jail-bird, is as impertinent as it is nauseous.&nbsp; I
have no faith in converted burglars.&nbsp; The entire scaffold is
a most unpretending construction, and situated in any other yard
but Old Bailey might pass observation as a highly-polished and
tidy out-house.&nbsp; The floor is level with the outer yard, so
that the chief actor is spared the painful necessity of trying to
ascend a flight of steps with quaking knees and an air of assumed
levity.&nbsp; A few steps, quite unobservable whilst standing on
the &ldquo;drop,&rdquo; lead down from the back of the flooring
into a bricked pit below, and a long bolt, worked by a wheel,
enables this apparently solid flooring to split from the centre
and to launch the victim in mid-air into the centre of this truly
&ldquo;bottomless pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; I minutely examined all this,
and (as its thorough <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>dusting necessitated) rubbed and
burnished every portion I could think of.&nbsp; My
<i>confr&egrave;re</i>, meanwhile, was on his hands and knees,
scrubbing away like grim death, and preparing the floor for the
ceremony that was to take place a few days hence.&nbsp; Mike all
this time was giving me the benefit of his vast experience; and
as he appeared to hear everything that was going on, he led me to
understand that eight <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> on
Monday next would witness one of those dreadful private
executions that periodically take place, witnessed by none but
prison officials, and associated, I verily believe, in many
instances by circumstances of brutality that would not admit of
publicity.&nbsp; He added that we might by luck get a view of the
procession, or at least hear a little, for, as he considerately
pointed out, our cells actually overlooked the yard.&nbsp; I was
most anxious to hear how we might attain to this unusual
excitement, and listened attentively whilst Mike enlightened me
in something of the following style:&mdash;&ldquo;Yer see,
they&rsquo;ll begin to fake the cove about eight&mdash;ah, afore
that, and none of us, see, will be allowed out that morning, you
bet; so if we can get a bit of glass out of the
windey&mdash;see&mdash;and plug it round <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>wi&rsquo;
bread, why none on &rsquo;em wud be none the wiser, and we might
see a rare lot; never you mind, leave it to me, and to-morrow
when I cleans your cell, I&rsquo;ll fix it for yer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was indeed something to look forward to, and next morning
when Mike appeared he led me to understand, by the most hideous
grimaces, that he had succeeded on his own window, and prepared
to do the same by mine; so leaving him to himself, I withdrew
into another cell, for it is a peculiarity of prison system that
if two men are together, or even near one another, they are
invariably watched, but if alone they are comparatively
unobserved, and free to prosecute any undertaking without the
least risk of detection.&nbsp; Mike&rsquo;s gestures, accompanied
by a rolling of his eyes in the direction of the window,
convinced me on my return that he had succeeded in his
undertaking, and having the highest opinion of his constructive
and destructive capabilities, I determined not to approach the
window nor to test his work till the supreme moment
arrived.&nbsp; Mike was one of those individuals who undergo
imprisonment as a matter of course, and with considerably greater
advantage than most men.&nbsp; I do not here include myself, for
mine was an <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>exceptional case; he had benefited by the experience of
years, and though only a young man, appeared to be intimate with
every prison in the kingdom; he was, moreover, a most willing and
respectful man and a capital worker, and, as such, a favourite
with the warders, who knew they could always depend on a job
being well done by him; he was, consequently, all day employed on
odd jobs, which carried with them privileges that enabled him to
roam about and give the uninitiated&mdash;such as
myself&mdash;the benefit of his profound and varied
experience.&nbsp; Mike, I fear, was a terrible ruffian; he was
now awaiting his trial for burglary and personal violence, and
though he assured me it was a mere nothing, and a grossly
exaggerated and trumped-up charge, I gleaned from the facts that
came out at his trial that he had rifled the contents of a small
shop in the City Road, and that when the old woman who lived on
the premises had ventured to remonstrate, that Mike had marked
his sense of such an unjustifiable proceeding by half throttling
her, and eventually making away &ldquo;for a little
season.&rdquo;&nbsp; He assured me, however, it was
&ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; adding, however, that as it was his fourth
conviction, he quite expected penal <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>servitude.&nbsp; He informed me also
that he had written an elaborate defence, which he proposed
reading to the judge and jury.&nbsp; This defence he insisted on
showing me, and I am bound to say that a more damning document,
or one more capable of hanging a man, I never saw; but luck and
circumstances happily (for him) prevented him carrying out his
intention of reading it, and Mike by the omission got off with
two years&rsquo; hard labour.&nbsp; Mr. Rose, who was about
four-feet-four in his stockings, communicated to me, amongst
other interesting facts, that he was a volunteer, and I could not
help realising on various occasions after he had been performing
violent exercise in my cell, that there was some truth in the
adage that &ldquo;a Rose by any name would smell as
sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mike, in short, was a character, and whether
in chapel, where he apparently led the choir and knew every
response by heart, or in the prison, where he appeared <i>au
courant</i> with everything and everybody, I found him a most
useful neighbour, invariably obliging and respectful, and willing
to turn his hand to anything.</p>
<h2><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A PRIVATE EXECUTION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eventful day at length dawned
when the scaffold was to be brought into requisition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The condemned sermon&rdquo; of the day before, to say
nothing of the evident bustle that was going on, had sufficiently
prepared our minds for what was about to happen; and the getting
our breakfasts half an hour earlier, and the omission of the
usual passage cleaning, all clearly pointed to some unusual
occurrence.&nbsp; My friend the warder, too, kept me thoroughly
<i>au courant</i> with what was passing, and when giving me my
breakfast added, &ldquo;Well, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be back just
yet, as I&rsquo;ve got to assist at a little business down below
that will take about an hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; After, therefore, he
had left me, I mounted my stool, and having contemplated
Mike&rsquo;s handiwork with considerable satisfaction, removed
the pane of glass and awaited the <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>procession with very much the same
sensation that I have looked out for the passing of the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s Show or Mr. Hengler&rsquo;s circus.&nbsp; The view
I anticipated can hardly be said to have been obtained under the
most favourable circumstances.&nbsp; Perched on a stool, and
liable, if detected, of getting into a very serious scrape, was
in itself sufficient to infuse a certain amount of alloy into the
transaction; but when to all this must be added my own
feelings&mdash;that here was I, <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span>
prisoner actually confined within the same walls, and watching
the execution of <span class="GutSmall">ANOTHER</span>
prisoner&mdash;it will readily be conceived that a piquancy was
introduced into the proceeding such as seldom or ever has fallen
to the lot of an individual in my position.&nbsp; I could not
have had long to wait, though the discomfort of my position and
the anxiety attending it made it appear a matter of hours; and no
twenty stone of humanity ever suffered more torture than I did
whilst with craned neck and squinting through a crevice I awaited
the advent of this hideous procession.&nbsp; The dismal toll of
St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s bell and the distant tramp of advancing
footsteps, however, announced that the &ldquo;time had
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could distinctly hear the
&ldquo;Ordinary&rdquo; repeating in very ordinary tones <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>portions of
the Burial Service as the weird procession passed below me; a
dense fog made it very indistinct, but there it was almost
beneath me&mdash;the warders first, then the Governor, and then
the condemned man trussed like a turkey, supported by Marwood,
and immediately preceded by the chaplain.&nbsp; I could have
dropped a biscuit amongst the party, so near were they, as they
passed through a wicket and were lost to sight.&nbsp; A solemn
silence now ensued, followed after a few moments that appeared
like hours by a terrible thud; and I pictured to myself the
lately scrubbed floor giving way, and my fellow-prisoner
suspended mid-air in that dark and bottomless pit.&nbsp; The
closing of the outer shed doors recalled me to my senses, and the
approaching sound of footsteps, as the &ldquo;small and early
party&rdquo; dispersed, some to breakfast and some to the morning
paper, but all to reassemble an hour hence for the inquest, the
quicklime, the thrusting into a hole, and the general
obliteration of the morning&rsquo;s work, suggested to me the
advisability of at once restoring my apartment to its normal
condition.&nbsp; So with one piece of bread jammed into the
window, and another jammed into my mouth, I resumed my breakfast
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>as if
perfectly oblivious of the terrible drama that had just taken
place.&nbsp; A few hours later we were exercising in the
identical yard, and the modest coach-house with its closed doors
looked as disused as the portals of a swimming-bath on Christmas
Day.</p>
<p>The scene just enacted and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of my
breakfast forcibly recalled to my mind an execution I witnessed
many years ago from, as I believe, the identical eating-house
that had just supplied me with my breakfast.&nbsp; It was in
&rsquo;65, as near as I can recollect, that myself and three or
four others engaged a room on the first floor with two windows to
witness the execution of M&uuml;ller for the murder of Mr.
Briggs.&nbsp; A public hanging has been so often and so
graphically described that I hesitate to attempt to add anything
that is not already known.&nbsp; On the night before (Sunday) we
agreed to rendezvous at 10 o&rsquo;clock at the Raleigh
Club.&nbsp; It was raining in torrents, and it was a question in
our minds whether or no we should brave the elements; but an
empty four-wheeler standing outside settled the point, and we
proceeded on our ghastly journey.&nbsp; As it turned out, the
deluge was all in our favour, for had it been fine we should <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>never have
got near the place, and would assuredly have shared the fate of a
cab-load of young Guardsmen who had preceded us about an hour,
and who unluckily arrived between the showers and never got
beyond Newgate Lane; at this point they were politely but firmly
invited to descend, stripped to their shirts, and then asked
where the cabman should drive them to.&nbsp; We, however, were
more fortunate.&nbsp; In a sheet of water that even the stoutest
burglar found to be irresistible, we alighted in a comparatively
deserted street in front of our unpretending coffee-house; and a
few minutes found us in a cosy room with a blazing fire, and a
servant who had preceded us laying out the contents of a hamper
of prog.&nbsp; The scene on the night previous to a public
execution afforded a study of the dark side of nature, not to be
obtained under any other conditions.&nbsp; The lowest scum of
London appeared to be here collected in dense masses, which, as
the hour of execution approached, amounted, according to the
<i>Times</i>, to at least 100,000 people.&nbsp; The front of
Newgate was strongly barricaded, huge barriers of stout beams
traversing the street in all directions; they were intended as a
precaution against the pressure of the crowd; <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>they,
however, answered another purpose, not wholly anticipated by the
authorities.&nbsp; As the crowd increased, so wholesale highway
robberies were of momentary occurrence; and victims in the hands
of some two or three desperate ruffians were as far from help as
though divided by a continent from the battalions of police that
surrounded the scaffold.</p>
<p>The scene that met our view as we pulled up the windows and
looked out on the black night and its still blacker accompanyists
baffles description.&nbsp; A surging mass, with here and there a
flickering torch, rolled and roared before us; above this weird
scene arose the voices of men and women shouting, singing,
blaspheming; and as night advanced, and the liquor gained firmer
mastery, it seemed as if hell had delivered up its victims.&nbsp;
To approach the window was a matter of danger; volleys of mud
immediately saluted us, accompanied by more blasphemy and shouts
of defiance.&nbsp; It was difficult to believe we were in the
centre of a civilised capital that vaunted its religion and yet
meted out justice in such a form.</p>
<p>The first step towards the morning&rsquo;s work was the
appearance of workmen about 4 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>;
this was <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>immediately followed by a rumbling sound, and we
realized that the scaffold was being dragged round.&nbsp; A grim,
square, box-like apparatus was now indistinctly visible, as it
was slowly backed against the &ldquo;debtors&rsquo;
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lights now flickered about the scaffold; it
was the workmen fixing the crossbeams and uprights.&nbsp; Every
stroke of the hammer must have vibrated through the condemned
cells, and warned the wakeful occupant that his time was nearly
come.&nbsp; These cells are situated at the corner nearest
Holborn, and passed by thousands daily who little know how much
misery that bleak white wall divides them from.&nbsp; Gradually
as day dawned the scene became more animated, and battalions of
police marched down and surrounded the scaffold.&nbsp; Meanwhile
a little unpretending door was gently opened; this is the
&ldquo;debtors&rsquo; door,&rdquo; and leads direct through the
kitchen on to the scaffold.&nbsp; The kitchen on these occasions
is turned into a temporary mausoleum, and draped with tawdry
black hangings, which conceal the pots and pans, and produce an
effect supposed to be more in keeping with the solemn
occasion.&nbsp; From our standpoint everything was visible inside
the kitchen and on the scaffold; to the surging mass <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>in the
streets below this bird&rsquo;s-eye view was, however,
denied.&nbsp; Presently an old and decrepit man made his
appearance, and cautiously &ldquo;tested&rdquo; the drop; but a
foolish impulse of curiosity led him to peep over the drapery,
and a yell of execration saluted him.&nbsp; This was Calcraft,
the hangman, hoary-headed and tottering and utterly past his
work.</p>
<p>The tolling of St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s about 7.30 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> announced the approach of the hour
of execution; meanwhile a steady rain was falling, which,
however, in no way decreased the ever-increasing crowd.&nbsp; As
far as the eye could reach was a sea of human faces.&nbsp; Roofs,
windows, church rails, and empty vans&mdash;all were pressed into
the service, and tightly packed with human beings eager to catch
a glimpse of a fellow-creature on the last stage of life&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; The rain by this time had made the drop slippery,
and necessitated precautions on behalf of the living if not on
those appointed to die; so sand was thrown over a portion (not of
the drop&mdash;that would have been superfluous), but on the
side, the only portion that was not to give way.&nbsp; It was
suggestive of the pitfalls used for trapping wild beasts&mdash;a
few twigs and a handful of earth, <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and below a gaping chasm.&nbsp; Here,
however, all was reversed; there was no need to deceive the chief
actor by resorting to such a subterfuge: he was to expiate his
crime with all the publicity a humane government could
devise.&nbsp; The sand was for the benefit of the
&ldquo;ordinary,&rdquo; the minister of religion, who was to
offer dying consolation at 8 and breakfast at 9 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span></p>
<p>The procession now appeared, winding its way through the
kitchen, and in the centre of the group walked M&uuml;ller, a
sickly, delicate-looking lad, securely pinioned and literally as
white as marble.&nbsp; As he reached the platform, he looked up,
and placed himself immediately under the hanging chain.&nbsp; At
the end of this chain was a hook, which was eventually attached
to the hemp round the poor wretch&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; The
concluding ceremonies did not take long, considering how feeble
the aged hangman was.&nbsp; A white cap was first placed over his
face, then his ankles were strapped together, and finally the
fatal noose was put round his neck, the end of which was then
attached to the hook.&nbsp; I fancy I can see Calcraft now,
laying the &ldquo;slack&rdquo; of the rope that was to give the
fall lightly on the doomed man&rsquo;s shoulder, so as to
preclude the <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>possibility of a hitch, and then stepping on tiptoe down
the steps and disappearing below.&nbsp; The silence now was truly
awful.&nbsp; I felt my heart in my mouth; it was the most
terrific suspense I had ever realized.&nbsp; I felt myself
involuntarily saying, &ldquo;He could be saved <span
class="GutSmall">YET</span>, <span class="GutSmall">YET</span>,
<span class="GutSmall">YET</span>;&rdquo; and then a thud, that
vibrated through the street, announced that M&uuml;ller was
launched into eternity.&nbsp; My eyes were literally glued to the
spot.&nbsp; I was fascinated by the awful sight; not a detail
escaped me.&nbsp; Calcraft meanwhile, apparently not satisfied
with his handiwork, seized hold of the wretch&rsquo;s feet and
pressed on them for some seconds with all his weight, and with a
last approving look shambled back into the prison.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the white cap was getting tighter and tighter, until it
looked ready to burst; and a faint blue speck that had almost
immediately appeared on the carotid artery after the drop fell
gradually became more livid till it assumed the appearance of a
huge black bruise.&nbsp; Death, I should say, must have been
instantaneous, for he never stirred a muscle, and the only
movement that was visible was that from the gradually stretching
rope as the body kept slowly swinging round and round.&nbsp; The
hanging of the body for <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>an hour constituted part of the
sentence, an interval that was not lost upon the multitude
below.&nbsp; The drunken again took up their ribald songs,
conspicuous amongst which was one that had done duty pretty well
through the night, and ended with, &ldquo;M&uuml;ller,
M&uuml;ller, he&rsquo;s the man&rdquo;; but the pickpockets and
the highwaymen reaped the greatest benefit.&nbsp; It can hardly
be credited that respectable old City men on their way to
business, with watch-chains and scarf-pins, in clean white
shirt-fronts, and with unmistakable signs of having spent the
night in bed, should have had the foolhardiness to venture into
such a crowd, but there they were in dozens.&nbsp; They had not
long to wait for the reward of their temerity.&nbsp; Gangs of
ruffians at once surrounded them; and whilst one held them by
each arm, another was rifling their pockets.&nbsp; Watches,
chains, and scarf-pins passed from hand to hand with the rapidity
of an eel; meanwhile their piteous shouts of
&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; &ldquo;Police!&rdquo;
were utterly unavailing.&nbsp; The barriers were doing their duty
too well, and the hundreds of constables within a few yards were
perfectly powerless to get through the living rampart.</p>
<p>From our window I saw an interesting case of <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>mistaken
identity, and I was glad to have the opportunity of saving an
innocent man from arrest.&nbsp; The incident was referred to in
the next day&rsquo;s papers, and was briefly this.&nbsp; A
well-dressed old man had had his scarf-pin pulled out, and a
policeman by this time being luckily near, a lad standing by was
taxed with the theft.&nbsp; We, however, from our vantage ground
had seen the whole affair, and recognized the real culprit, who
was standing coolly by whilst the innocent man was being marched
off.&nbsp; By shouting and hammering with our sticks, we
eventually succeeded in attracting the notice of the constable,
and pointed out the real culprit, and the pin was then and there
found on him.</p>
<p>Whilst these incidents were going on, 9 o&rsquo;clock was
gradually approaching, the hour when the body was to be cut
down.&nbsp; A few minutes previously two prisoners had brought
out the shell&mdash;a common deal one, perforated with
holes.&nbsp; I remember remarking at the time how small it
looked; and my conjecture proved correct, for it was with
difficulty that the body could be squeezed in.&nbsp; It showed
with what consummate skill and regard to economy the exact size
of the body must have <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>been calculated.&nbsp; With its
clothes on, the corpse was too big for the shell; divested of
them, however, there was doubtless ample room, not only for it,
but for the layers of quicklime that enveloped it.&nbsp; And now
Calcraft again appeared, and producing a clasp-knife, with one
arm he hugged the body and with the other severed the rope.&nbsp;
It required two slashes of the feeble old arm to complete this
final ceremony, and then the head fell with a flop on the old
man&rsquo;s breast, who, staggering under the weight, jammed it
into the shell.&nbsp; The two prisoners then carried it into the
prison, the debtors&rsquo; door closed till again required to
open for a similar tragedy, and the crowd meanwhile having
sufficiently decreased, enabled us to go home to bed, and to
dream of the horrors of the past twelve hours.</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;NEWGATE
ETIQUETTE.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Visits</span> at Newgate are made under
great disadvantage, and have not even the recommendation of
privacy.&nbsp; A few of the more respectable (as regards clothes)
prisoners, such as myself, were allowed to see our daily visitors
in a portion of the enclosure a little removed, but still so near
the regular place that it was almost impossible to hear what was
said on account of the terrible roar made by the united lungs of
a hundred malefactors and their demonstrative friends.&nbsp;
Visits are only permitted between two and four o&rsquo;clock, and
as everybody comes about the same hour, the babel that ensues may
be readily conceived.&nbsp; As, moreover, we are untried, and
consequently innocent, people, these restrictions as to time and
numbers are clearly unjust, and merit alteration.&nbsp;
Solicitors are permitted to consult with their clients in glass
boxes, where all can be seen <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>but nothing heard.&nbsp; These cases
are situated in the direct route through which sight-seers are
conducted.&nbsp; An amusing incident occurred to me on one
occasion.&nbsp; I was in deep consultation with an eminent
solicitor of Gray&rsquo;s Inn Square, as a herd of some ten
country bumpkins, male and female, were being piloted about, and
I distinctly saw their conductor make a motion that evidently
referred to me.&nbsp; I cannot, of course, say what that
communication was, but it was evidently enough to raise the
desire on the part of one of the females to have a closer
inspection of me.&nbsp; With a light step, such as a sack of
coals might make on a skating rink, the biped cautiously stalked
me, and deliberately flattened her &ldquo;tip-tilted,&rdquo;
turn-up nose against the window.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s
warning, I bounded from my chair and shouted out, &ldquo;Sixpence
extra for the chamber of horrors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fair creature
jumped as if shot from a catapult, and I fancy I can now see her
black stockings and frowzy petticoat as she flew towards her
party.&nbsp; Hemma Hann had been taught a lesson!</p>
<p>There are certain abuses that call for immediate and rigorous
suppression at Newgate, the more so as it is a place where
prisoners are, as it were, in <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>transit, and thus many things that
might be made real advantages are (or were a year ago) gross
injustices.&nbsp; I refer specially to the
&ldquo;privilege&rdquo; of procuring your own food.&nbsp; Men
awaiting trial are naturally ignorant of the system and its
details, and I cannot do better than state what occurred to me,
and the absolute injustice I was subject to; for my case is only
similar to that of many others, who have not perhaps the same
advantage as I have of ventilating the grievance.</p>
<p>I was asked on the first day what I would like to order, and
deeming it safest to avoid mistakes I gave one order to hold good
daily.&nbsp; I ordered a pint of milk and a plate of bread and
butter for breakfast; a plate of meat and a pint of ale for
dinner; and for supper a pint of milk and a plate of bread and
butter.&nbsp; Now I ask any unprejudiced reader what ought such
food to have cost, supplied to a prisoner from a common
coffee-house in such a district?</p>
<p>I have been at the trouble of enquiring at this and similar
eating-houses, and find that their prices for the above articles
are, for a pint of milk, 4d.; bread and butter, 3d.; a plate of
meat and vegetables, 8d.; bread, 1d.; and a pint of ale, 4d.; <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>total, 2s.
3d.&nbsp; But a free citizen and a caged prisoner are two
different things, for which there are two different prices.&nbsp;
For the above homely fare I was charged 3s. 6d. a day, and as my
money was in the hands of the prison authorities, I had
absolutely no redress.&nbsp; No notice was ever taken of a
complaint, though I made a dozen.&nbsp; Often my beer did not
come, but I was charged all the same; my milk was frequently
forgotten, and eventually appeared an hour after in a boiled
state&mdash;and yet this scandalous charge was paid daily.&nbsp;
I ask any humane government, is not this a shame?&nbsp; What is
the only inference that can possibly be drawn?&nbsp; Surely it is
within the bounds of possibility that these officials, badly paid
and half fed, supplement their day&rsquo;s food at the expense of
the prisoner; if they do not, would they permit the coffee-house
keeper to reap such profits?&nbsp; Common sense suggests there
must be collusion.&nbsp; I am fortified in this opinion by what
I&rsquo;ve lately seen.&nbsp; During the past few weeks
I&rsquo;ve been round this grimy district, and seen the turnkeys
running in and out from the wicket opposite into certain of these
houses that I could indicate, and the honorary membership that
appears to exist leaves no room for any <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>interpretation but the one suggested.&nbsp; I sincerely
hope this matter may not be deemed too trivial to be looked into,
and that it will be the means of introducing an improvement of
the system, whereby a prisoner can procure articles at fixed
prices, and that this tariff is hung up in every cell.&nbsp; My
treatment was so glaringly unjust that I cannot lose the
opportunity of giving publicity to the sequel.&nbsp; On the eve
of my departure to &ldquo;Cold Bath Fields,&rdquo; I was asked to
sign the usual paper which purported to show how my money,
&pound;1 5s. 4d., had been expended, and as a proof of my being
satisfied with it.&nbsp; This I distinctly declined to do; and
one would have supposed that in an establishment where
&ldquo;justice&rdquo; plays so prominent a part, my refusal would
at least have elicited an enquiry.&nbsp; On the contrary,
however, pressure was actually brought to bear on me, and even
the Governor lowered himself by making it a personal
matter.&nbsp; The man, as I said before, was not a gentleman by
birth, but I was hardly prepared for such violent partizanship on
his part.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I hear you decline to sign the receipt
for your money.&nbsp; Very well; I shall retain the money, and
report your conduct to the Governor of Cold Bath
Fields.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>dignified speech that greeted me next
morning.&nbsp; In reply, I assured him that I certainly should
not sign, and he might report me to whomsoever he pleased.&nbsp;
Thus ended our squabble; and it might as well have been spared,
for I found on my arrival at Cold Bath Fields that only 4s.
5&frac12;d. had been sent with me, and that consequently the
eating-house man had been paid &pound;1 0s. 10&frac12;d. by his
patron the Governor on my behalf, and despite my protest.&nbsp;
With the abolition of Newgate as a prison, except during the
sessions, it is sincerely to be hoped that these crying scandals
have been abolished too.</p>
<p>One thing that struck me particularly was the small number of
warders in comparison to the prisoners.&nbsp; Seven or eight,
from the Governor to the lowest turnkey, comprised the entire
staff, and were responsible for the safety of some two hundred
prisoners.&nbsp; Such a number was clearly inadequate, and the
risk they ran, however remote, was forcibly brought to my notice
by a conversation I once overheard.&nbsp; Amongst others awaiting
trial was a desperate-looking ruffian of low stature, with bull
head and black shaggy eyebrows&mdash;a man who had undergone more
than one sentence of penal servitude, and who, to judge by his <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>appearance,
was capable of any atrocity.&nbsp; This ruffian was pointing out
one morning how easy it would be to make a dash at the warders,
and then, without the possibility of opposition, simply to walk
out.&nbsp; The plan certainly seems feasible, especially during
chapel, where four or five warders are absolutely at the mercy of
two hundred prisoners.&nbsp; One can only suppose that a moral
restraint exists, and on which the authorities rely, that would
prevent many from joining in such a mutiny, and who, if a choice
had to be made, would prefer to join issue with the warders
rather than with their unsavoury opponents.&nbsp; During the
sessions the regular staff is augmented by five or six additional
hands, for the most part feeble old men, suggestive of sandwich
men out of employment.&nbsp; I was much amused by one of these
patriarchs who was left in absolute and sole charge, and daily
superintended the exercise of some fifty or sixty
prisoners.&nbsp; I never lost an opportunity of having a chat
with him, as he stood shivering in a threadbare ulster, with a
dew-drop on his nose, a ragged comforter round his neck, and his
poor old gums rattling in the drafty yard.&nbsp; I found,
however, that he was not devoid of official dignity, and <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>had a very
high conception of the position and importance of
&ldquo;officers,&rdquo; as every turnkey likes to be
styled.&nbsp; I remember saying to the poor old chap one day,
&ldquo;You officers must have a very difficult duty to perform,
what between maintaining your dignity and doing your duty
strictly.&rdquo;&nbsp; A leer, such as one might associate with a
magpie looking down a marrow-bone, was all he vouchsafed in reply
for a moment, and I feared he suspected I was pulling his leg;
but I was eventually reassured by his replying, &ldquo;Yis,
there&rsquo;s no responsibler dooty than an
officer&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve always heard that you officers are sad
dogs;&rdquo; and as I moved away I heard the old gums clatter as
if pleased at the compliment, and if I had had a shilling in my
pocket I should certainly have given it to the old
&ldquo;officer.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first day of the sessions had
now arrived, and I rose with mingled feelings of anxiety and
pleasure; anxiety for what the day might bring forth, and
pleasure at the thought that anything was better than the
uncertainty that at present involved my future, and hailing with
delight the prospect of knowing the worst.&nbsp; I never
expected, however, that my case would be tried on the first day,
and <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>was
therefore considerably taken back when, about 3 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, my door was suddenly opened, and
with a &ldquo;Come along, you&rsquo;re wanted in the
Court,&rdquo; a warder made his appearance.&nbsp; The awful
reality now burst on me for the first time that I was on the
point of appearing in a criminal dock to answer a charge of
forgery, and uttering forged bills.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t weary the
reader by saying more than that I pleaded guilty to the uttering,
but denied the forging, as I still do, and ever shall; but being
informed that the two acts were considered synonymous, my plea
was registered as &ldquo;guilty,&rdquo; and I was sentenced to
eighteen months imprisonment with hard labour.&nbsp; I am now
entering on a phase of my career which may be considered as the
commencement proper of my narrative, and one that I expected,
from the steps that led up to it, would consist of harshness and
brutality, such as one reads of in stories of the Bastile and
other prisons; whereas, on the contrary, I was leaving all that
behind, and about to experience a kindness and consideration I
can never adequately describe or be sufficiently grateful
for.&nbsp; But a word or two is necessary before we leave Newgate
to enable me to describe the Old <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Bailey Court House and its sombre
approaches, its subterraneous passages, and dingy cells.&nbsp; I
must also make a digression to narrate the heart-breaking story
of a poor wretch which he himself told me, and which I&rsquo;ve
reason to believe is strictly true, and to which his position as
a man of title&mdash;I shall refrain from giving his
name&mdash;imparts a considerable degree of interest.&nbsp; It is
a tale which demonstrates to what a contemptible state a man can
bring himself by the excessive use of stimulants, and how that
degradation is augmented when wedded to immorality, culminating
in the inevitable shipwreck that waits on bright prospects and a
long rent roll when drink and prostitution appear at the altar,
only to be divorced, as in the present case, by a term of penal
servitude.</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TITLED CONVICT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning after my arrival at
Newgate it was with considerable surprise that I saw a man in
convict dress, who was apparently the object of special watch and
guard.&nbsp; My curiosity was considerably increased from the
circumstance of his being the only individual out of some two
hundred in this conspicuous attire; he was moreover clearly not a
novice, but wore the dreadful suit with the apparent ease of a
man to whom it was by no means a novelty.&nbsp; He looked
horribly ill, and a terrible eruption that showed itself on his
neck, face, and hands gave unmistakable evidence that the unhappy
wretch was literally rotten; added to this, however, there was a
something about him, a &ldquo;<i>je ne sais quoi</i>,&rdquo; that
marked the gentleman and asserted the blue blood, despite the
convict dress, the loathsome disease, and the degrading <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>surroundings.&nbsp; A fixed melancholy seemed never to
desert him.&nbsp; When he moved, it was with eyes cast down, and
nothing appeared to interest him; it was the motions of a human
machine, bowed down with grief or shame, or meditating some awful
vengeance.&nbsp; I was so struck with all this that I determined
to lose no opportunity of scraping an acquaintance with the
mysterious stranger.&nbsp; I enquired of a warder, but all he
knew or pretended to know was that he was undergoing a sentence
of 20 years&rsquo; penal servitude, and had lately been drafted
there from a convict prison; that he had only been there a few
days, and would in all probability be moved elsewhere very
shortly.&nbsp; Chance favoured my desire to make his
acquaintance.&nbsp; It was on a Saturday afternoon, a time
devoted to a very general and extra clean up, and when almost
everyone is put on a job.&nbsp; My warder&mdash;like a
brick&mdash;had put me, at my urgent request, to
&ldquo;dusting&rdquo; the rails, a duty, I had observed, at which
the convict was frequently employed.&nbsp; I got as near as
discretion would permit, and ventured to ask him who and what he
was.&nbsp; He looked at me at first with a mingled expression of
surprise and distrust, but being apparently reassured by either
<a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>my
manner or my dress, began in short, jerky sentences in something
of the following style: &ldquo;You ask me who I am.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a question I haven&rsquo;t heard for six long
years.&nbsp; Since that time I&rsquo;ve been an unit, 4016 of
Portland, and praying night and day that death would release
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was alarmed at his excited manner; his eyes
flashed, he quivered like a maniac, and I begged him to be
calm.&nbsp; This appeal seemed to touch some long dried-up
spring; kind words evidently sounded strange to him, and a tear
trickled down his seamed and hollow cheeks.&nbsp; The weakness,
however, was but momentary, and wiping his eyes with his coarse
blue handkerchief, he began in a melancholy voice the following
sad story:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me who I am, or rather who I was.&nbsp; Know,
then, that six years ago I was known as &mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
started at the name, for it was a well-known and titled
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;At an early age my parents died, leaving me the
possessor (under guardians) of &pound;20,000 a year, an estate in
England, and another in Ireland, a house in London, and an
ancient title.&nbsp; My uncle and guardian, alas! was actuated by
no affection for me, but considered that if he placed me under a
good tutor, <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>insured me a liberal education, and sent me to see the
world, he was fairly earning the handsome salary allowed him by
the Court of Chancery, whose ward I was.&nbsp; At the age of 18 I
started with my tutor on a three years&rsquo; tour, it having
been decided that I should thus have seen everything, and made a
fitting termination to the education of a man with the bright
prospects I so confidently considered were in store for me.&nbsp;
Would to God I had been born a navvy; I should never then have
become what you now see me.&nbsp; The eventful era in my life at
length arrived.&nbsp; After seeing everything and going half over
the world, I found myself in England again, and on the eve of
being invested with the absolute control of my huge
estates.&nbsp; I will not insult you, nor deceive myself, by
concealing any of my blemishes.&nbsp; Know, then, I was a
drunkard, a confirmed sot at 21, too weak to resist the dram
bottle, and capable of every folly, every crime, when under the
influence of its fatal spell.&nbsp; I moreover hated the society
of gentlemen, and was never happy except in low company.&nbsp; In
London, whither I came after taking possession of my estates, I
did not know a soul; the few respectable friends or relatives of
my father I studiously <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>avoided.&nbsp; Pleasure for me was
only to be attained by herding with cads and prostitutes.&nbsp;
My position, my title, my wealth, made this an easy task, and I
soon became acquainted with a number of that voracious,
threadbare class.&nbsp; My most intimate friends were broken-down
gentlemen and spendthrifts of shady reputation; fighting men and
banjo men, and blood-suckers of every type, who flattered my
vanity, and led me as it were, with the one hand, whilst they
rifled my pockets with the other.&nbsp; They ate at my expense,
they drank at my expense; I paid their debts in many instances,
and any rascal had only to recount to me a tissue of lies for me
to at once offer him consolation by the &lsquo;loan&rsquo; of a
cheque.&nbsp; &lsquo;What matters it,&rsquo; thought I;
&lsquo;was I not &mdash;, and had I not more money than I could
possibly spend in a century?&rsquo;&nbsp; I was passionately fond
of theatres, not respectable ones where I should have had to
behave decently, but low East-end and transpontine ones, where I
was a very swan amongst the geese, and where my title and wealth
obtained me the inestimable privilege of going behind the scenes,
and throwing money about in handfuls.&nbsp; On these almost
nightly visits I was invariably dunned and asked for aid by every
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>designing knave; they saw I was a fool, and usually
drunk, and what I mistook for homage was in reality the treatment
that only a contemptible drunkard with money, such as I, ever
gets.&nbsp; Every scene-shifter had a harrowing tale, or an
imaginary subscription list, to all of whom I administered
bounteous monetary consolation; and any varlet with a whole hand,
and a greasy rag round it, at once received a &lsquo;fiver&rsquo;
as a mark of sympathy for his painful accident.&nbsp; In short, I
was a fool, looked on as only fit to be fleeced, and simply
tolerated for the sake of my money.&nbsp; Would to God I had
confined myself to these contemptible but otherwise harmless
follies!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on a dull foggy night&mdash;a night I can never
forget&mdash;that some half-dozen of my boon companions had been
dining with me at a celebrated restaurant.&nbsp; The
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the dessert had not been removed, and
they were sipping their coffee whilst I was settling the bill,
when a suggestion was made that we should go to the
&lsquo;Sussex.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Sussex&rsquo; was a very
disreputable theatre, situated somewhere over the water, and
supported entirely by the lowest classes and a few golden calves,
such as myself, who were serving their <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>apprenticeship, and who were permitted the inestimable
privilege of going behind the scenes&mdash;entering the
green-room, or indeed any room, and paying ten shillings a bottle
for as much fluid of an effervescent nature in champagne bottles
as anybody and everybody chose to call for.&nbsp; On these
occasions we were ushered into the sacred precincts, with a
certain amount of implied caution similar to and about as
necessary as that assumed by a ragamuffin in the streets when
asking you to buy a spurious edition of the <i>Fruits of
Philosophy</i>.&nbsp; This, however, in my ignorance, only
enhanced the pleasure.&nbsp; We were, as I believed,
participating in some illegal transaction, permitted only to the
most fortunate.&nbsp; As a fact, we were violating no law; and if
the Lord Chamberlain did not object, Scotland Yard certainly
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Etiquette on these occasions demanded that we
should be formally introduced to the various &lsquo;ladies&rsquo;
that frequented the green-room&mdash;a custom I considered highly
commendable, for in my ignorance I believed that not the
slightest difference existed between the highest exponent of
tragedy and the frowsiest ballet-girl in worsted tights and
spangles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this particular night, as I was watching <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the
transformation scene being &lsquo;set,&rsquo; and listening to
the sallies of the tawdry &lsquo;fairies&rsquo; that crowded the
wings, my attention was attracted by a tall woman, who was
gnawing a bone with a gusto that conveyed to me the impression
she hadn&rsquo;t eaten for a month.&nbsp; I felt for the poor
creature, and went and stood near her.&nbsp; I thought at the
time (for I was very drunk) that she was the most beautiful being
I had ever seen; her pink-and-white complexion (it was in reality
dabs of paint) appeared to me to be comparable only to a
beautiful shell.&nbsp; I was spellbound by the sight, and
instantaneously and hopelessly in love.&nbsp; It would have been
a mercy&mdash;may God forgive me!&mdash;if that bone had choked
her.&nbsp; That woman eventually became &lsquo;her
ladyship.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m anticipating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor fellow here became so affected that I begged him to
pause; it was, however, useless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of her in a measure sobered me, and I asked
her who and what she was.&nbsp; She told me a harrowing tale of
how she was the eldest of seven children; that her mother was
bed-ridden and her father blind; and how she toiled at a
sewing-machine all day and at the theatre all night, and <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>then only
earned a miserable pittance, barely sufficient to keep a roof
over their heads.&nbsp; The recital affected me considerably
(drunken people are easily moved to tears), as she went on to
tell me how she had been in the theatre since 11 that morning
(for it was the pantomime season, and there had been a morning
performance), and how she had not tasted food until a carpenter
had kindly given her the remains of his supper.&nbsp; I lost no
time in procuring a bottle of champagne, and felt happier than I
had for years as she placed a tumblerful to her parched lips and
drank it off at a gulp.&nbsp; A few moments later I saw
&lsquo;little Rosie&rsquo; (for so she told me her blind parent
loved to call her) being lashed to an &lsquo;iron,&rsquo; and
posing as an angel for the great transformation scene in course
of preparation.&nbsp; I subsequently discovered&mdash;though,
alas! too late&mdash;that &lsquo;little Rosie&rsquo; was nightly
to be seen outside the &lsquo;Criterion&rsquo; and in front of
the &lsquo;Raleigh,&rsquo; and was known as &lsquo;big
Rose.&rsquo;&nbsp; But my mind has again got in advance of my
story.&nbsp; Oh, dear! oh, dear! where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this stage I really got alarmed, far his excitement was
evidently increasing.&nbsp; Happily, however, a passing official
necessitated silence, and <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>he eventually resumed with
comparative composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not weary you with unnecessary details; suffice
it to say that within a month we were married, and the vows that
were made &rsquo;till death should us part&rsquo; were eventually
broken by the living death that consigned me to penal
servitude.&nbsp; After our marriage &lsquo;little
Rosie&rsquo;s&rsquo; nature gradually began to change; and the
frankness and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> that had so captivated
me gradually gave way to habits and sentiments that astonished
and alarmed me.&nbsp; I verily believe that, had I found in her
the woman I hoped and believed her to be, I should truly have
reformed, and given up that vile curse, drink.&nbsp; Instead of
that, however, I found at my elbow one who was always ready to
encourage me in the vice.&nbsp; Port was her favourite tipple,
and though my own state seldom permitted me to judge of her
consumption, still in my lucid intervals of sobriety I was
astonished at the amount she consumed.&nbsp; Gradually we began
to turn night into day, and nights of debauch regularly followed
the few hours of daylight we seldom or ever saw.&nbsp; Even yet I
had not abandoned all hope of reform.&nbsp; My conscience smote
me when I was sober enough <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>to heed it, and in hopes of avoiding
temptation I hurried with my wife to Ireland; but even here she
could not rest quiet.&nbsp; The cloven foot persisted in showing
itself, and we were tabooed by the whole county.&nbsp; In this I
found further cause for mortification&mdash;I who might have been
looked up to and sought after.&nbsp; I tried to spare my
wife&rsquo;s feelings by concealing the real cause of our
existence being ignored; but, fool that I was, I gave way to her
importunings, and actually called on those who had avoided
us.&nbsp; The well-merited reward of my temerity was not long in
coming.&nbsp; Some of the county families returned our cards by
post, whilst others sent them back by a servant; and at a
subscription ball that took place not long after we received the
cut dead.&nbsp; This filled up the cup of my humiliation, and I
rushed back to London.&nbsp; I had realised the fact that virtue
won&rsquo;t herd with vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cousin about this time made his appearance, and
gradually became a daily visitor; and had my muddled faculties
been more capable of forming an opinion, I might have been
puzzled how a well-dressed and apparently gentlemanly man could
be the nephew of either the blind father or the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>bed-ridden
mother.&nbsp; Gradually, however, my suspicions were aroused, and
I employed a detective to watch them both.&nbsp; He fulfilled his
duty, alas! too well, and I received incontestable proof that my
wife was a &mdash;, and that the &lsquo;cousin&rsquo; was a man
with whom she had lived for years.&nbsp; A sickly child, too,
that frequently came to the house, and whom she often told me,
with tears in her eyes, was her &lsquo;dead
sister&rsquo;s,&rsquo; I had reason to suspect was a much nearer
relative.&nbsp; But my feelings outstride my discretion.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m again going too fast, and surely you&rsquo;ve heard
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged him to continue, for I was deeply interested in his
tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife now began to display reckless extravagance;
nothing was good enough for her; the handsome settlement I had
made on her failed to meet a fraction of her expenses, and she
became so degraded as to borrow money of my very servants.&nbsp;
Love, they say, is blind, and in my case, I fear, was frequently
blind drunk.&nbsp; On these occasions I would agree to anything,
and gradually signed away first one thing, and then another, till
I found myself divested of house, estates, everything, and a
pensioner on my wife&rsquo;s bounty.&nbsp; It <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>may seem
incredible that anything should be capable of bringing the blush
of shame to such as I&mdash;I who for six long years have worn
this dreadful dress&mdash;but, believe me, my cheeks tingle even
now when I think of it all.&nbsp; I was at length compelled to
resort to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and watch, chain, ring,
everything, found their way to an establishment in &mdash;
Road.&nbsp; My credit, once good, was entirely gone; tradesmen to
whom I owed money began to dun me; others refused me the smallest
credit; servants, washerwomen, butchers, and bakers all were
creditors; writs and County Court summonses were of daily
occurrence; and the family mansion that my ancestors had never
disgraced was in the hands of the bailiffs.&nbsp; How I cried out
in my anguish will never be known.&nbsp; Relations I had none to
whom I could apply for sympathy or advice.&nbsp; My only friend
was &lsquo;drink,&rsquo; and in my misery I turned to it with
redoubled energy.&nbsp; I have not much more to tell; the climax
which brought me here was very near at hand.&nbsp; One afternoon
I had returned to our lodgings (we were then in apartments at 28,
&mdash; Place) rather sooner than expected from a fruitless
endeavour to borrow a few pounds.&nbsp; I had <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>stopped at
every public-house, and gulped down a dram of cheap spirits, in
hopes of lightening my sorrow; I was, I believe, almost mad with
misery and drink.&nbsp; As I entered the room the first thing
that met my gaze was the hated &lsquo;Cousin.&rsquo;&nbsp; To
seize a loaded pistol that always hung over the mantel-piece was
the work of a second, and, without aim, without deliberation, I
fired.&nbsp; The report and my wife&rsquo;s screams alarmed a
policeman who happened to be passing by; he entered and found her
swooning on the ground, but happily uninjured.&nbsp; Thank God!
I&rsquo;m free of that crime&mdash;and the tell-tale bullet
lodged in the wall.&nbsp; Concealment was hopeless.&nbsp; I was
there and then arrested, and eventually sentenced, on the
evidence of my wife and her paramour, to &lsquo;twenty
years&rsquo; penal servitude.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His excited state alarmed me.&nbsp; I feared we should be
observed, but it was hopeless to attempt to check him as, with
eyes starting, and the tears flowing fast, he added, pointing to
his seamed and blotchy face: &ldquo;The worst has yet to be told;
look at these scars that I shall carry with me to the
grave.&nbsp; Can you suspect what they are?&nbsp; My
&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;they have noticed
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>I
never saw him again, but heard, months after, that the unhappy
man had died, and that the bright expectations accruing from
youth, birth, and fortune, that had been formed six short years
ago, lie buried in a nameless convict&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>Not long ago I walked round to the pawn shop in &mdash; Road,
with the morbid desire of testing the truth of some of his
assertions, and found that the watch, chain, and ring were still
there.&nbsp; I informed the worthy pawnbroker of the real name
and sad fate of his former customer, and was almost tempted to
purchase the cat&rsquo;s-eye as a souvenir of my quasi-friend;
but more prudent counsels prevailed, and I relegated them to the
auction-room, to go forth with their crests and monograms, a sad
memento of fallen greatness.</p>
<h2><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> my sudden summons to attend
the Court I found myself in the yard below, where, in company
with some twenty others, I was placed in rotation according to a
list the Governor and chief warder were
&ldquo;checking.&rdquo;&nbsp; This formula being completed, we
proceeded in single file, preceded by an &ldquo;officer&rdquo;
and followed by a patriarch, along the subterraneous passages
that connect the prison with the Old Bailey Court-house.&nbsp;
These passages are the last remnants of the old prison, and
demonstrate the change that has taken place in the accepted
notions of insuring the safety of prisoners.&nbsp; Every few
yards a massive iron door some inches thick, with huge bolts and
a ponderous key, bars the passage.&nbsp; Having passed through
all these, we came to a halt in a dark recess, partially lighted
by gas, on each side of which were arched cells, <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>suggestive
of those of the Adelphi.&nbsp; Into each of these five or six of
us were conducted, for by the prison system prisoners before
trial may be herded together; after conviction, however, all that
ceases, and one is &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; henceforth to be
isolated.&nbsp; After a delay of some twenty minutes, and during
which I was initiated into the style of society I might expect
for the future, my name was called and I was conducted up a
wooden stair.&nbsp; The hum of voices&mdash;for I could see
nothing&mdash;indicated to me that I was in the vicinity of the
Court and on the stair leading into the dock&mdash;one of those
mysterious boxes I had often seen from the opposite side, where
criminals popped up and popped down so suddenly and so
mysteriously.</p>
<p>I had seen many murderers sentenced to death from that very
dock, and was often puzzled at the geography of the place; all
this, however, was now made perfectly clear.&nbsp; It was with
mingled feelings of astonishment and bewilderment that I found
myself, suddenly and without warning, the observed of all
observers.&nbsp; The crowded Court, the forest of well-known
faces&mdash;vindictive prosecutors, reluctant witnesses,
quasi-friends come to gloat over my misfortune, and one or two
real sympathisers&mdash;all <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>appeared glued together to my
bewildered gaze.&nbsp; Beyond, and seated against the wall, were
innumerable figures robed in flowing scarlet gowns, and
presenting to my senses so ghastly and weird a picture that I can
compare it to nothing but that impressive trial scene in
&ldquo;The Bells,&rdquo; to which Mr. Irving imparts such
terrible reality.&nbsp; It only required the mesmerist to
complete the resemblance; and he must have been there, although
invisible, for I was mesmerized, or at least completely
dazed.&nbsp; By degrees, however, I recovered my senses, and
embracing the whole scene, summed up the vanity of human sympathy
and the value to be attached to friendship, as it is
called.&nbsp; Reader, whoever you are, take the word of a man who
has been rich and surrounded by every luxury.&nbsp; Friends will
cluster round you in your prosperity as they did round me, and
when they have eaten you out of house and home, and robbed you by
fair means or foul, by card playing and racing, you must not be
surprised if you discover that the most vindictive and
uncompromising are those you least expected.&nbsp; &ldquo;For it
was not an enemy that reproached me, then I could have borne
it&mdash;neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify
himself against me; but it <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>was a man, mine equal, my guide, and
my acquaintance&mdash;yea, mine own familiar friend in whom I
trusted, which did eat of my bread&mdash;hath lifted up his heel
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ordeal at length had been gone through, and I was on my
return journey to the prison as a &ldquo;convicted
prisoner.&rdquo;&nbsp; A prisoner after sentence consists of only
two classes, the &ldquo;convict&rdquo; and the &ldquo;convicted
prisoner,&rdquo; and it is marvellous how soon the difference
shows itself.&nbsp; The &ldquo;convicted prisoner&rdquo; finds
absolutely no change beyond being deprived of the questionable
privilege of procuring his own food at an exorbitant rate.&nbsp;
With the &ldquo;convict,&rdquo; however, things are very
different.&nbsp; Immediately after sentence he is stripped of all
his clothes, his hair and beard are cropped as close as scissors
can do it, and he is metamorphosized by the assumption of the
coarse brown and black striped convict dress.&nbsp; The change is
so marvellous that it is difficult at first to recognize a
man.&nbsp; One poor fellow I saw, a gentlemanly-looking man from
the Post-office, that I frequently spoke to, was so changed when
I saw him next morning in Chapel that I could not for the moment
recognize the poor wretch who kept grinning at me with an air of
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>levity
as assumed as it was painful.&nbsp; I am not ashamed to admit
that I thanked Providence I had escaped that fearful doom.&nbsp;
It is not generally known that two years&rsquo; imprisonment is
the limit of a sentence of hard labour, after which the next
higher punishment involves five years&rsquo; penal
servitude.&nbsp; There is a vast deal of ignorance displayed on
this subject, even by those who might be supposed to know
better.&nbsp; It is generally believed that imprisonment with
hard labour is a severer punishment than penal servitude.&nbsp;
No greater fallacy ever existed.&nbsp; I base my assertion, not
so much on personal experience (for I was exceptionally
fortunate), as on what I saw of the treatment of others; and I
confidently assert&mdash;and my opinion would be corroborated by
every respectable prisoner (if such an anomaly can
exist)&mdash;that two years&rsquo; &ldquo;hard labour&rdquo; is
an infinitely lighter punishment than even two years of penal
servitude would be; and I can only attribute the general
acceptation of this error to the fact that convicts get a little
more food than convicted prisoners, and prisoners as a rule will
do anything for &ldquo;grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have now brought my experiences of Newgate to a close, and
shall briefly describe our departure <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>to our final and respective
destinations.&nbsp; An unusual bustle one morning indicated that
something out of the ordinary was about to happen, and though we
received no actual warning, it was generally buzzed about that we
were to make a start after breakfast.&nbsp; At breakfast-time the
warder told me to put my things together, and half an hour later
found me and sixteen others marshalled in the corridor, where,
being carefully compared with our respective descriptions, we
were formally handed over to a detachment of warders from
Coldbath Fields.&nbsp; Other parties were being simultaneously
paraded for Holloway and Pentonville, the latter all in convict
dress and as pitiable a looking set as can well be
conceived.&nbsp; I discovered, both now and subsequently, that a
human being is invariably referred to as if he were a
parcel.&nbsp; Thus, on arrival, one is said to be
&ldquo;received,&rdquo; and one&rsquo;s departure is described as
being &ldquo;sent out.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is not intended in an
offensive sense, but may be taken rather as a figure of
speech.&nbsp; In the adjoining yard were half a dozen
vans&mdash;indeed, I had never before seen such a formidable
array, except, perhaps, a meet of the four-in-hand club on a
rainy day&mdash;and into one of these I was politely <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>conducted,
with a degree of precaution as unnecessary as it was absurd.</p>
<p>No reader can accuse me of rounding the points of this
ungarnished story, or endeavouring to conceal any incident,
however unpleasant.&nbsp; As, however, my subsequent experiences
may discover a treatment so kind and exceptional as to appear
almost incredible, I must only ask the reader to credit me with
the veracity that my previous frankness entitles me to
expect.&nbsp; My anxiety on this point is considerably enhanced
by the contradiction it will bear to other narratives I have
read, and which, purporting to describe prison life, invariably
represent it as a hot-bed of cruelty, where prisoners are starved
and otherwise ill-treated, all of which I emphatically deny, and
cause me to doubt whether one single specimen of these so-called
personal narratives is anything else but an &ldquo;idle
tale,&rdquo; written with a view of enlisting sympathy, and
possibly turning an honest penny.&nbsp; If these writers and
these prisoners had seen as much as I have (from outside) of
prisons on the Continent, in Morocco, and in China, they would
think themselves very fortunate in their present quarters.&nbsp;
I&mdash;who have seen prisoners starving in <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>prisons in
Morocco, and absolutely &ldquo;unfed,&rdquo; except by the
charity of visitors, who usually scramble a few shillings&rsquo;
worth of bread amongst them; and who, for a dollar to the jailor,
have seen a Chinaman at Shanghai brought out, made to kneel down
and have his head sliced off like a water-melon&mdash;have no
patience with these well-fed, well-clothed, and well-housed
rascals.&nbsp; I would send all these discontented burglars and
their &ldquo;converted&rdquo; biographers to China or Morocco,
and omit to supply them with return tickets.&nbsp; I have lately
read a book connected with penal servitude, by an anonymous
writer, in which this innocent lamb is whining throughout of his
hardship in being compelled to herd with criminals; and it says a
great deal for his imitative capacity that he should so naturally
and so thoroughly have adopted the almost universal
&ldquo;injured innocence&rdquo; tactics of the habitual
criminal.&nbsp; One great nuisance at all prisons is the almost
universal habit that prisoners have of protesting their
innocence; they protest it so often to everybody on every
possible occasion, that they eventually begin to believe that
they really are innocent.&nbsp; I found these guileless creatures
great bores; indeed I am (I am convinced) well within <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the mark
when I assert that there were only about three-and-twenty guilty
persons besides myself amongst the fifteen hundred prisoners in
Coldbath Fields.&nbsp; This compulsory herding with innocent
burglars is a great trial, and one that never enters into the
calculation of a judge.</p>
<p>A short drive at a good pace on this early December morning
brought us to the gates of Coldbath Fields Prison; and as I
stepped out, I could not help recalling Dante&rsquo;s famous
line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All hope abandon ye who enter
here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It only proves how apt one is to form erroneous ideas from
first impressions.&nbsp; I was never more mistaken in my
life.</p>
<h2><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;CORPULENCY.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>From my birth up to within the past twelve months I have had
the misfortune to be afflicted with one of the most dreadful
diseases that flesh is heir to.&nbsp; It is one that entails
suffering both to body and mind, and from which a vast proportion
of humanity suffers in a more or less aggravated form.&nbsp; It
is a slow and insidious disease that never decreases of its own
accord, but on the contrary develops itself with one&rsquo;s
increasing years as surely as the most virulent cancer.&nbsp; It
has this advantage, however, over this latter dreadful
complaint&mdash;that it invariably yields to treatment
conscientiously applied; but it has also this disadvantage, that,
whereas other afflictions invariably enlist the sympathy of our
fellow-creatures, this one never fails to be jeered and hooted at
and turned into ridicule by the coarse and vulgar of <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>our
species.&nbsp; This complaint, surprising as it may appear, is
held in contempt by most of the faculty, and I doubt whether it
has ever received baptism in the English or any other
pharmacopoeia.&nbsp; I will therefore without further preamble
state, for the benefit of afflicted humanity, that it is called
&ldquo;obesity.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of my remarks I may be
led into the use of what may appear strong expressions; and if I
should unwittingly offend the susceptibilities of any fat reader,
he or she will, I trust, forgive it, as coming from one who has,
as it were, gone through the mill, and been subjected to the like
ridicule and the like temptations as themselves.</p>
<p>For thirty-eight years I&rsquo;ve been a martyr to
obesity.&nbsp; At my birth, as I am credibly informed, I was
enormous&mdash;a freak of nature that was clearly intended for
twins.&nbsp; As I developed into boyhood I still maintained the
same pronounced pattern; and when I entered the Army as an
ensign, it was said, with a certain amount of truth, that I was
eighteen years of age and 18 stone in weight.&nbsp; I am
particular in giving these otherwise uninteresting details, for I
am aware from experience how fat people catch at every straw to
evade a &ldquo;regimen,&rdquo; <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and invariably say as I did,
&ldquo;Nothing will make me thin,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried
everything,&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural in our
family,&rdquo; &ldquo;My father weighed nineteen stone,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; I say to these people, &ldquo;This is
rubbish.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care if your father weighed forty
and your grandmother fifty stone; I&rsquo;ll <span
class="GutSmall">GUARANTEE</span> to <span
class="GutSmall">REDUCE</span> you perceptibly and with <span
class="GutSmall">PERFECT SAFETY</span> if you&rsquo;ll guarantee
to follow my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the past fifteen years I&rsquo;ve tried every remedy,
with, however, the invariable result&mdash;that they did me no
good, or at least so little that I came to the conclusion that
the result did not repay the inconvenience.&nbsp; It must here be
understood that when I refer to &ldquo;remedies,&rdquo; I do not
speak of some that aspire to that title, which, if they
don&rsquo;t kill, don&rsquo;t certainly cure; nor of others which
will assuredly first cure and then as certainly kill&mdash;though
I confess to have given even these a trial, and swallowed
ingredients that don&rsquo;t come well out of analysis.&nbsp; I
would warn all zealous fat people to be careful of these
concoctions, and at least consult a physician before saturating
their systems with poisons.&nbsp; I do not even refer to other
&ldquo;remedies,&rdquo; admittedly and which I have found <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>safe,
though before concluding my hints I shall have a word to say
about them, and give my opinion of their respective titles to
merit, on the principle that &ldquo;a wink is as good as a nod to
a blind horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; In support of my claim to credence I
may state that my appearance was known to almost everybody, many
of whom have since seen me as I now am; and though I cannot
produce testimonials from a corpulent clergyman in Australia who
weighed 40 stone and now only 14, and never felt better in his
life, nor from the fat Countess del Quackador, of Buenos Ayres,
who attributes her recovery to the sole use of &mdash;, still I
can produce myself, and seeing is usually admitted to be half way
to believing.&nbsp; My theory is based on that of that excellent
man and apostle of corpulency, the late Mr. Banting&mdash;a
theory which, as propounded by him, was in a crude state, but,
like all great discoveries, is capable of improvement based on
experience.&nbsp; In short, I agree with him as a whole, but
differ on many essential points.&nbsp; I felt, whilst practising
his treatment, that something was wanting, and my experience has
since discovered what that something is.&nbsp; Others like myself
may have found the Banting theory deficient <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>beyond a
certain point.&nbsp; I would ask these to give mine a fair trial
for three months.</p>
<p>Anyone who has waded through my narrative will observe that
the dietary I subsisted on for some months of my life was in
itself incapable of reducing a man; and it was thanks to the
liberal margin I had to work upon, and the facilities I enjoyed
for not only weighing myself, but also my food, that I attribute
in a great measure the perfecting of my theory, and the reliance
that may be placed on it.&nbsp; Banting lays down as a principle
that &ldquo;quantity may fairly be left to the natural appetite,
provided the quality is rigidly adhered to.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this
I disagree with him, but on the contrary confidently assert that
until the subject is reduced to its proper size, it is absolutely
imperative to limit the quantity as well as the quality.&nbsp;
The quantity, however, is a liberal one, both as regards solid
and fluid.&nbsp; At the same time it must be remembered that
great ignorance exists as to the weight of the commonest articles
of dietary, and to form an estimate of their weight by their
appearance can only be attained by experience.&nbsp; One often
hears of persons that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t eat more than a
bird,&rdquo; and stout people are invariably <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>accredited
with being small eaters.&nbsp; It would astonish these persons to
find that they consume in blissful ignorance three or four pounds
a day.&nbsp; I would recommend every corpulent person to purchase
a set of cheap scales capable of weighing accurately one, two,
four, and eight ounces (an ounce is a word that conveys a
diminutive impression, yet eight of them constitute half a
pound); these can be procured at any ironmonger&rsquo;s at a cost
of two or three shillings.&nbsp; I would also suggest a half-pint
measure; this involves an outlay of about twopence.&nbsp; Without
these two articles no corpulent person&rsquo;s house can be
considered properly furnished.&nbsp; Before commencing the
experiment it is indispensable to be accurately weighed, taking
care to weigh <i>all</i> you have on (separately and at another
time), so that your exact weight can be arrived at, whether
attired in summer or winter clothing.&nbsp; By degrees this
weekly weighing becomes an amusement, and one that increases as
your weight decreases.</p>
<p>The following table may be accepted as fairly accurate, and
shows what the respective natural weights of persons ought to
be.&nbsp; I do not lay down a hard and fast rule, that in no case
ought it <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>to be exceeded.&nbsp; On the contrary, my theory, based
on personal experience, convinces me that every person has his
own peculiar weight and dimensions as intended by Nature, and
when he has found his &ldquo;bearings&rdquo;&mdash;which he will
have no difficulty in doing, as I shall explain hereafter, by
unmistakable symptoms&mdash;any further reduction is attended
with difficulty, and is, indeed, unnecessary.&nbsp; Taken,
however, as something to work upon, the following scale, obtained
from a leading insurance company, may be studied with advantage;
and when the corpulent reader has arrived within half a stone of
the specified weight&mdash;a generous concession surely&mdash;he
may then, but not till then, begin to take occasional liberties,
both as regards quantity and quality.&nbsp; I am offering these
remarks to those only who conscientiously intend to give my
theory a fair trial.&nbsp; To those lukewarm disciples who would
like to be thin, without possessing the self-denial necessary for
this most simple remedy, I cannot do better than apply the views
I once heard expressed by a piper to a cockney officer in a
Highland regiment who asked him to play the &ldquo;Mabel&rdquo;
valse&mdash;that &ldquo;it would only be making a fool of the
tune and a fool of the pipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the reader has attained to within half a stone of these
figures, he will have the game in his own hands, and can regulate
his system with as much accuracy as a clock.&nbsp; On November
25th, 1881, I weighed the enormous weight of 19 stone 13
lbs.&nbsp; On October 1st, 1882, I weighed 12 stone 4 lbs., and
with a loss of 18 inches in girth&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a reduction
of 7 stone 9 lbs.; and as this can be verified, my opinion is at
least worthy of attention.&nbsp; I consider it absolutely
necessary that one should at first limit one&rsquo;s self to 2
pounds solid and 3 pints fluid daily; and I cannot do better than
give the dietary I have pursued for the past five or six months
in the south of France:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>At</i> 6 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&mdash;I take
half-a-pint of black coffee and one ounce of coarse <i>brown</i>
bread or biscuit.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span><i>At</i> 9 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&mdash;I
breakfast off four ounces of lean meat, three ounces of brown
bread or biscuit, and half-a-pint of black coffee.</p>
<p><i>At</i> 2 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&mdash;I have
six ounces lean meat, three ounces brown bread or biscuit, six
ounces green vegetables, and half-a-pint of any fluid except ale,
effervescing wines, or a&euml;rated waters.</p>
<p><i>After Dinner</i>&mdash;I take half-a-pint of coffee.</p>
<p><i>At</i> 6 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&mdash;I take
half-a-pint of coffee.</p>
<p><i>At Supper</i>&mdash;I have two ounces brown bread or
biscuit, and a couple of glasses of sherry or claret.</p>
<p>Independently of this I eat fruit <i>ad lib.</i>&nbsp; I find
as a broad rule that all vegetables that grow above ground, such
as cauliflower, artichokes, sprouts, &amp;c. (except peas and
rice), are conducive to health; whereas all that grow
underground, such as potatoes, carrots, beet-root, &amp;c., are
fat persons&rsquo; poison.&nbsp; It is immaterial what meat one
eats, whether fish, flesh&mdash;except pork&mdash;or fowl, but it
is necessary to avoid the fat.&nbsp; Stout persons will find, as
I did, an inclination to smuggle in a little, but they must flee
from the temptation.&nbsp; A severe trial at first is confining
one&rsquo;s self to this quantity and quality, whilst others are
indulging to a greater extent at the same table; but the feeling
soon <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>wears off, and must be looked on as the penalty
attached to Pharaoh&rsquo;s fat kine.&nbsp; Fat people never
consider that if they were suffering from a cancer they would not
hesitate to submit to amputation&mdash;and amputation is not
unattended with pain&mdash;to prolong life; and yet they waver
regarding the treatment of corpulency&mdash;an equally certain
enemy to life&mdash;with a painless remedy!&nbsp; Do they
invariably also, in other paths of life, return good for evil,
and heap coals of fire on an enemy&rsquo;s head?&nbsp; And yet
here is a hideous, ungainly, deadly foe pampered and fattened at
the cost of life, comfort, and appearance.&nbsp; And then the
ridicule!&nbsp; I ask you, amiable fat reader, is that
agreeable?&nbsp; I would, in fact, make obesity penal, as calling
for special legislation, whereby the police would be justified in
arresting oleaginous pedestrians, clapping them into the scales
at the nearest police-station, and if they exceeded a certain
number of feet in circumference, or weight, at once procure their
summary imprisonment, without the option of a fine.&nbsp; The
streets would thus be cleared of these fleshy obstructions;
besides which, if the law recognises attempted suicide as a crime
in one way, why not in another?&nbsp; The dietary I have <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>suggested
is conducive to constipation, a result that brown bread remedies
considerably, if not entirely removes.&nbsp; There are brown
breads and brown breads, however, and after trying a good many, I
have come to the conclusion that the &ldquo;whole meal
bread&rdquo; made by Messrs. Hill and Son, of 60, Bishopsgate
Street Within, and 3, Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, is
admirably adapted to the requirements of the corpulent.&nbsp; It
keeps the bowels open, is delicious in flavour, and entirely free
from the alum that finds its way into many other kinds.&nbsp;
Some six months ago I had an interview with a member of this
firm, and explained my views of the advantages that would attend
a biscuit made of the same meal.&nbsp; I have lately tasted some
made by them, that are apparently specially adapted for the
consumption of the corpulent; and as they have agents in every
part of the kingdom, the regular supply is within the reach of
all.&nbsp; I strongly commend these to all my readers.&nbsp;
There is one more item to which I attach great importance,
namely, the taking at bed-time of one teaspoonful of
liquorice-powder (German Pharmacopoeia) in half a tumbler of
water.&nbsp; This quantity may be gradually increased, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>as
circumstances seem to require; and as a good deal depends on the
purity and freshness of this drug, the advisability of going to a
good chemist cannot be too strongly urged.&nbsp; I have often
been told that smoking is injurious to the corpulent, but this I
consider sheer nonsense.&nbsp; I smoke from morning to night,
and, on the contrary, believe it makes up for the larger amount
of food one had previously been in the habit of consuming.&nbsp;
In America, where I spent many happy years, I was never without
&ldquo;a smoke,&rdquo; a habit I still continue, though with the
disadvantage of having to substitute British for the fragrant
Oronoko and Perique tobaccos.&nbsp; This latter is, in my
estimation, whether used as cigar, cigarette, or in a pipe, the
finest tobacco in the world.&nbsp; I have discovered, beyond
doubt, that a person afflicted with obesity is affected by the
smallest transgression of the strict <i>regimen</i>.&nbsp; I have
for experiment taken one lump of sugar in my coffee at meals, and
found that this single innovation has produced an increase of a
pound in my weight in a week; indeed, a person disposed to this
affliction is as sensitive as an aneroid.&nbsp; It was in May
last that I first determined to reap at least one benefit from my
late <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>incarceration, and, by a careful regard to quantity and
quality, to test effects that my position and the time at my
disposal offered great facilities for, and thus reduce corpulency
to a science, and its reduction to a certainty.&nbsp; A reference
to other portions of this narrative will put it beyond a doubt
that the unlimited amount of food at my disposal made this an
easy task.&nbsp; I will not here go into these particulars, as a
detailed account necessary for the unbroken interest in my
narrative will be found elsewhere, but will confine myself to
giving a table of the reduction I made in myself by my own
free-will and determination.</p>

<p>Making a total loss of 107 lbs. (7 stone 9 lbs.) in <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>318
days.&nbsp; This loss was not obtained without great
determination and self denial, but was it not worth it?&nbsp; If
any corpulent reader could see my photograph of November, 1881,
and November, 1882, he would, I think, admit it was, and receive
a stimulus to persevere as I did.&nbsp; A reference to the above
table will show no diminution between June 20th and July
2nd.&nbsp; I attribute this to my having found what I call my
&ldquo;bearings,&rdquo; for though continuing in the same course,
I could not get away from 15 stone 8 lbs.&nbsp; I persisted,
however, and eventually succeeded; and the next date shows a
steady decline.&nbsp; I would recommend no experimentalist to
transgress this bound, and when they find that after a
fortnight&rsquo;s continuance of the strict system they have
obtained no perceptible diminution of weight they should <span
class="GutSmall">STOP</span>; they have found their
&ldquo;bearings,&rdquo; and any further perseverance is attended
with unnecessary inconvenience.&nbsp; The time, however, has then
come for most careful watch and guard, and the slightest liberty
is accompanied by a proportionate increase.&nbsp; Yielding to the
kindly meant advice of friends, I some months ago took new milk
and other fattening luxuries, with the result of increasing a
stone <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>in
six weeks.&nbsp; I had, however, the remedy in my own hands, and
can now play fast and loose with an amusing degree of
certainty.&nbsp; I can, without an effort, reduce or increase my
weight three or four pounds in a week, and having attained the
comfortable weight of 13 stone 10 lbs, I am determined never
again to turn the scale beyond 14 stone.&nbsp; I allow this
margin as the legitimate perquisite of advancing years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I guarantee reduction with perfect safety to
all who will honestly try the following <i>regimen</i> in its
integrity for three months:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Breakfast</i>&mdash;Eight ounces coarse brown bread
(yesterday&rsquo;s baking); four ounces lean meat; one pint
coffee or other fluid.</p>
<p><i>Dinner</i>.&mdash;Four and a-half ounces brown bread; six
ounces any lean meat (or, if preferred as an occasional
substitute, half-pint of soup&mdash;ten ounces); six ounces green
vegetables; one pint fluid.</p>
<p><i>Tea</i>.&mdash;One and a-half ounces brown bread; half a
pint of coffee.</p>
<p><i>Supper</i>.&mdash;One or two glasses of wine, or a glass of
spirit and water (except rum); and two ounces biscuit.</p>
<p><i>Total</i>.&mdash;Two pounds solid and three pints
fluid.</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span><i>Bed-time</i>.&mdash;One teaspoonful liquorice powder
(German pharmacopoeia) in half a tumbler of water.</p>
<p>I have parcelled the above out into meals to meet the ordinary
taste, though it is quite immaterial how or when the quantity is
taken.&nbsp; It is, moreover, a matter of perfect indifference
whether tea (no sugar or milk), claret, or, in fact, any other
fluid (except ale and a&euml;rated or effervescing drinks), is
substituted for coffee.</p>
<p>The principal points on which I differ from the so-called
&ldquo;Banting&rdquo; system are:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The limiting of the quantity till a proper
reduction has taken place.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The occasional substituting (if desired) of soup
for meat, which I have found attended with no inconvenience.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The substitution of brown bread or brown biscuit
for toast or rusk&mdash;thereby obviating constipation.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) The taking of liquorice powder at bed-time in lieu
of the alkaline on rising.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated the above may appear trifles; their
advantage can only be estimated by those who have tried both
systems.</p>

138</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">COLDBATH FIELDS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the key turned in the ponderous
door, and I found myself, with sixteen others, standing on a huge
mat in a dismal corridor, I realised that I had arrived
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; or at what I might consider as such,
for&mdash;as I imagined&mdash;the next eighteen months.&nbsp; I
had already passed one week in Newgate, and really thought, in
the sanguineness of my heart, that I had made a considerable hole
in my sentence, and that the remaining seventy-seven weeks would
soon slip by.&nbsp; My first intimation that the place was
inhabited, except by mutes, was hearing a metallic voice saying,
<i>pro bono publico</i>, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that talking is
not permitted here&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
peering into the gloom I discovered that the voice belonged to a
bald head, and the bald head to a venerable head warder.&nbsp;
The poor old man was <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>super-annuated shortly after, and
evidently meant to show the recruits he was not to be trifled
with, and that there was life in the old dog yet.&nbsp; We were
next taken through endless corridors to the &ldquo;Reception
Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can any name be more suggestive of satire,
except perhaps &ldquo;Mount Pleasant,&rdquo; the hill so called
on which the prison stands, bounded at each corner by a
public-house, and a &ldquo;pop-shop&rdquo; here and there
sandwiched in between!&nbsp; The reception we received in the
Reception Room was far from a cordial one; it was, indeed, as
cold as the weather outside.&nbsp; The Reception Room is octagon
shape, with benches arranged over the entire floor; on these we
were directed to sit down, about a yard apart.&nbsp; In front was
a large desk and a high stool, on which a turnkey was perched,
whose sole duty was to prevent the least intercourse between the
prisoners; in fact, the entire room and its fittings conveyed the
impression of being connected with a charity school for
mutes.&nbsp; The Reception Room is the first and last place a
prisoner passes through; it is here that, on his arrival, he is
transformed into the Queen&rsquo;s livery, and again on his
departure reverts to citizen&rsquo;s clothing&mdash;it is, in
fact, the filter through <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>which the dregs of London have to
pass before becoming sufficiently purified to be again permitted
to mingle with the pure stream outside.&nbsp; The silence of the
grave is its normal condition, where the novice receives a
foretaste of the &ldquo;silent system.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>We must have sat thus silently for at least an hour, when a
door from outside was unlocked, and a warder, accompanied by two
prisoners carrying sacks, made their appearance.&nbsp; The
contents of these, being thrown on the floor, were discovered to
be boots, not new ones, or even pairs, but very old and dirty,
mended and patched with lumps of leather on the soles, on the
heels, and, in fact, anywhere.&nbsp; We were now invited to
&ldquo;fit&rdquo; ourselves, and a scramble ensued amongst a
section of the prisoners.&nbsp; I selected a nondescript pair,
tied by a cord, as unsuited a couple as ever were united, the
right foot of which would have fitted an elephant, and the left
have been tight for a cork leg.&nbsp; With this unsavoury
acquisition on my lap I resumed my seat.&nbsp; It is the custom,
as I before hinted, to show one the worst of everything at first,
and the rule that applied to the cells was clearly in force
regarding the boots.&nbsp; I found, however, that after the
general &ldquo;fit,&rdquo; and when a <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>comparative lull ensued, that some
of the more fortunate ones had better ones supplied, and I
shortly after received a new pair in exchange for my
&ldquo;fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next thing that made its appearance
was a basket full of caps and stocks.&nbsp; Here I was less
fortunate, and the size of my head precluded the possibility of a
fit.&nbsp; The basket was followed by a bundle of wooden labels,
on each of which our various names were inscribed; with these in
our hands, we were told to &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
label considerably puzzled me.&nbsp; We now found ourselves in
the corridor devoted to baths, where each man received a bundle
of clothing.&nbsp; The object of the label now manifested itself;
it was to attach to our clothes&mdash;not likely to be wanted for
some time.&nbsp; The bundles consisted of a pair of blue worsted
socks, a blue striped shirt, a blue pocket-handkerchief the
thickness of a tile, a towel as coarse as a nutmeg-grater, and a
suit of clothes.&nbsp; The clothes, when new, are really very
good, and by no means objectionable.&nbsp; There is nothing of
that conspicuous, degrading appearance about them that
distinguishes the convict dress.&nbsp; On the contrary, the
trousers and vest are well cut, and made of good warm mole-skin;
the <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>jacket is a capital material, and were it not for
painful associations, and the possibility of unpleasant
attentions from zealous policemen, I would gladly have a suit of
the jacket material.&nbsp; The otherwise agreeable effect is
somewhat marred by the broad-arrow Government mark, which appears
to be applied regardless of all symmetry and indeed of all
expense.&nbsp; No general rule apparently exists as to the
marking of this cloth, which one must conclude is left entirely
to the discretion and good taste of the individual armed with the
paint-pot.&nbsp; This want of uniformity thus lends an agreeable
variety to the different appearances of individuals; for my part,
I always felt that I resembled the &ldquo;Seven of
Spades.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Baths are, as I found them at Newgate,
in themselves excellent, and if one could forget one&rsquo;s
probable predecessor, the enjoyment would be considerably
enhanced.&nbsp; They were, I daresay, perfectly clean, though I
always fancied I detected a Seven-Dials mouse-trap flavour in the
atmosphere, and in the water.&nbsp; The bath, as an institution,
admirably fulfils its twofold function; it insures a thorough
wash, and removes the last trace of one&rsquo;s former
self.&nbsp; Entering the apartment with the bundle <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>under my
arm, I proceeded to divest myself of my clothing.&nbsp; I had
not, however, been many seconds submerged before an eye was
applied to the peephole, followed by the entrance of a turnkey,
and all my clothing was carefully removed.&nbsp; The process of
re-dressing was not an easy one; nothing came within a foot of my
size except the socks; the overalls declined to do anything like
meeting, and a piece of twine was pressed into the service.&nbsp;
The waistcoat was another trial, necessitating the turnkey
calling for the &ldquo;corpulent waistcoat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trussed
up in this fashion, I patiently awaited the
&ldquo;corpulent&rdquo; waistcoat, a marvel of tailoring.&nbsp;
The chest measurement could not have exceeded thirty-six; whilst
the waist (?) must have been one hundred.&nbsp; From the
&ldquo;corpulent&rdquo; one only reaching half-way down my chest,
I concluded that its original owner must have been about
five-foot-nothing.&nbsp; But the warder very good-naturedly said
&ldquo;he&rsquo;d make it all right,&rdquo; and not long after I
was measured, and within twenty-four hours possessed a brand-new
suit.&nbsp; My enormous size also necessitated special shirts; a
couple were made in an incredibly short space of time, and all
through my career I experienced the benefit of wearing linen <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>that had
never been contaminated by contact with &ldquo;baser
metal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The warder to whom I was indebted for these
delicate attentions was one of the best in the prison, and though
I never came much in contact with him, I understood he was a
great favourite.&nbsp; He was connected with the stores, and
could get more done in an hour than one of the blustering kind in
a week.&nbsp; Before leaving the baths, I would wish to draw
attention to a custom that calls for immediate alteration.&nbsp;
The system at present in vogue is for all prisoners to have a
bath immediately on arrival, <i>after</i> which they undergo
medical examination.&nbsp; At these examinations, as is well
known, many creatures are found, not only to be alive with
vermin, but suffering from itch.&nbsp; With these facts, that are
not to be gainsaid, common sense surely suggests a medical
examination <i>before</i> instead of <i>after</i> the bath, an
arrangement which, however disagreeable to the surgeons, would be
a considerable benefit to the prison inmates generally.&nbsp; It
is a common occurrence for men who have been in prison three, and
even six months, to be found to be suffering from itch, and it is
equally certain that they caught it in these baths, which are
<i>pro bono publico</i> once <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>a fortnight.&nbsp; I thank God I was
spared any of these &ldquo;plagues,&rdquo; though I never took my
periodical dip without finding my thoughts wandering to Scotland
and the Argyll (not Bignell&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>Having joined my companions we were reconducted to the
reception-room, which by this time was crowded by contributions
from the various Police-courts.&nbsp; My Newgate friend Mike was
now thoroughly in his element; he appeared to take a pride in
showing his intimacy with the etiquette of the place, and seemed
quite hurt if a warder didn&rsquo;t recognize him as an old
acquaintance.&nbsp; As I looked down the benches now fully
occupied, I fancied I could have distinguished every new comer
from the <i>habitu&eacute;</i> by the way they wore their
caps.&nbsp; The new hands put them on in such a manner that they
resembled a quartern loaf, whilst the more experienced&mdash;such
as Mike&mdash;cocked them with a jaunty air as if proud of the
effect.&nbsp; At a later period I observed that a great deal of
vanity existed on the subject of toilet amongst the regular
jail-birds: they plastered down their hair&mdash;as I
know&mdash;with the greasy skimmings of their soup, or
applications of suet pudding; and many&mdash;incredible as it may
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>appear&mdash;shaved regularly with their tin knives and
the back of a plate for a mirror.&nbsp; Hair-cutting now
commenced, and anyone whose hair was too long was effectually
operated on.&nbsp; It is a mistake to suppose that
prisoners&rsquo; hair is cut in the barbarous manner that is
applied to convicts; nothing is done to them beyond what a
soldier has to submit to&mdash;namely, having his hair and beard
of moderate length.&nbsp; As I have all through life kept what I
have as close as possible, the hair-cutting in my case was
dispensed with, and through the subsequent few months I had
always to ask for the services of the barber, and invariably
received the same reply&mdash;&ldquo;Surely, yours is short
enough!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was one item in the crop I was never
subjected to&mdash;probably because my moustache was
small&mdash;but which I certainly should not have liked; it was
the habit of clipping the ends square to the lip.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve often seen men in London and elsewhere with this
distinctive crop, which I should now invariably associate with
prison life; and if I met a Bishop who affected this style it
would be difficult to convince me that I had not met him
&ldquo;elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next person that intruded
himself <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>was&mdash;as I was informed&mdash;a chaplain.&nbsp; His
attire was far from clerical, and consisted of a billycock
hat&mdash;not a good, honest, disreputable one, but one of your
shabby-genteels, so infinitely more fatal&mdash;a coat that
suggested Crosse and Blackwell&rsquo;s cut, and boots
suspiciously resembling the prison make.&nbsp; He interrogated me
in my turn, though I fear his curiosity was far from
satisfied.&nbsp; His mania was the ceremony of
&ldquo;confirmation,&rdquo; and when he discovered I had omitted
that essential form, I at once passed into his black books.&nbsp;
Happily, I was perfectly indifferent to his displeasure or his
patronage&mdash;indeed the latter would have been the most
unbearable.&nbsp; He never forgave me, however, as a
discreditable tiff we had long after conclusively proved.&nbsp;
As I got to see more of this shining light I began to suspect
that he must have been a Jesuit, he did so much to make
Protestantism obnoxious.</p>
<p>I was next passed on to a schoolmaster&mdash;a gradual
improvement in accordance with the system is here
apparent&mdash;who amused me by inquiring if I could read, how I
spelt &ldquo;oxen,&rdquo; if I could write, and if I thought I
could &ldquo;write a letter?&rdquo;&nbsp; This latter question
was very conclusively <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>set at rest a week later by an
incident that occurred in which I was the chief culprit, and
which necessitated the collective wisdom of the Home Office and a
full bench of the Visiting Justices to adjudicate upon.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, I had &ldquo;passed&rdquo; this scorching examination,
and had to sit quietly by and listen to illiterate costermongers
and rascally pickpockets being severally questioned.&nbsp; It had
its amusing features, although I felt how degrading it was for a
public school-boy and a gentleman by birth and education to be
compelled under any combination of circumstances to submit to be
catechized by such a trio.&nbsp; The next person to appear was
the doctor&mdash;the dearest, kindest old gentleman I ever
met.&nbsp; His manner to all was alike considerate and kind; one,
moreover, who seemed to be aware that the position of a gentleman
(unless usurped by a cad) loses nothing of its dignity by a
courteous bearing towards inferiors or men placed in a painful
position&mdash;a manner that inspired respect and yet precluded
the possibility of a liberty, a refreshing contrast to a
nondescript that had preceded him, and the beau id&eacute;al of a
fine old English gentleman.&nbsp; Stripped to the waist and <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>behind a
screen, we were one by one subjected to a minute
examination.&nbsp; A schemer had a very sorry look-out with this
eminent physician; no dodge could possibly avail, for he was
intimate with every &ldquo;ailment&rdquo; that criminal flesh is
heir to.&nbsp; It was amusing, after hearing some rascal relate
the numerous complaints from which he was suffering, to hear the
surgeon quietly say with a smile, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll soon be
all right,&rdquo; and to see the hospital warder write down,
&ldquo;Fit, hard labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; This short and apparently
informal ceremony is the most momentous in one&rsquo;s future
career, and though unaware of it at the time, I was not surprised
later on at the importance attached to it by the experienced
criminal.&nbsp; By it one&rsquo;s future treatment is entirely
guided, and the class of labour is carefully selected in
accordance with its decision.&nbsp; A card, then and there signed
by the surgeon, and which is always fixed on one&rsquo;s cell
door, decides one&rsquo;s future vocation; and &ldquo;Hard
labour,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Light labour and bed,&rdquo; bear a
significance incredible to the uninitiated.&nbsp; As I stood
before the kind old man stripped to the waist (or rather to where
my waist now is) I was amused by his astonishment at my enormous
proportions.&nbsp; I satisfied him I was not <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>deceiving
him by a reference to an operation I had once undergone; and
this, coupled with my unnatural size, decided him I was incapable
of hard labour, and the words, &ldquo;Light labour and
bed,&rdquo; were recorded on my card.&nbsp; Before many hours had
passed I realized the benefit of those magic words.&nbsp; These
preliminaries, as is always the case in well-constructed dramas
or farces, only led up to the event of the day&mdash;the
inspection by the Governor.&nbsp; In Her Majesty&rsquo;s prisons
these individuals are clothed in attributes something more than
mortal, and receive an amount of homage sufficient to turn the
head of a fool or a snob.&nbsp; In this instance the Governor was
neither, and though a strict disciplinarian, was the justest and
&ldquo;straightest&rdquo; man I ever met.&nbsp; Prisoners and
warders were equally amenable to his discipline, and the
slightest dereliction of duty brought him down on you like a load
of bricks.&nbsp; There was no abuse or verbosity accompanying
this discipline, and though he was feared, I believe he was
equally liked and respected by every man in the prison.&nbsp; The
advent of such a personage naturally involved a proportionate
amount of preparation, and everything received an overhaul.&nbsp;
Men who wore Her <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Majesty&rsquo;s livery for the first time, and were
mere babes in the mysteries of its graceful adjustment, were told
to put their stocks &ldquo;square on,&rdquo; or button this
button and not that of their vests and jackets; lumps of coal
that had burned crooked were carefully straightened, and even the
coal-box got a lick of whitewash at the last moment.&nbsp; We
were then rehearsed in a sort of drill: every man was informed
that when &ldquo;attention&rdquo; was called he was at once to
&ldquo;spring&rdquo; up smartly and remain standing&mdash;an old
vagrant, aged 100 to judge by his appearance,
&ldquo;sprang&rdquo; with so much zeal that I really thought he
had cricked his neck.&nbsp; When all the preparations were
considered complete, and we had attained an efficiency worthy the
reputation of the &ldquo;North Corks,&rdquo; and as some minutes
had yet to elapse before the great man&rsquo;s arrival, it was
deemed advisable to fix our thoughts in the same reverential
groove by reading certain rules for our future guidance.&nbsp;
The following notice is one of the half-dozen that hang up in
every cell&mdash;all of which I shall produce hereafter.&nbsp;
They can hardly be considered as light reading, or such as one
would select unless absolutely compelled; nevertheless, they
afforded me a certain amount of occupation by <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>learning
them by heart during the many solitary hours I spent
hereafter:&mdash;</p>
<h3>ABSTRACT OF THE REGULATIONS</h3>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A slamming of doors and turning of keys, and a perfect Babel
of voices shouting &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; heralded the
Governor&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; I can only compare the discord
to that which invariably accompanies the progress of an African
tribe through a friendly village.&nbsp; A few pop-guns and a
tom-tom or two would certainly make the resemblance more
complete, though they would probably be objected to by the Home
Office on the plea of want of precedent.</p>
<p>The halo of veneration that surrounds a prison <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>governor is
by no means confined to himself, but obliquely and in a modified
form imparts itself to the humblest of his followers.&nbsp; A
miserable door-slammer that usually accompanied him, and combined
with this important duty the occasional distribution of letters,
amused me on one occasion when I ventured to ask him if he had a
letter for me.&nbsp; Such a liberty &ldquo;from the likes of me
to the likes of him&rdquo; was hardly to be tolerated; and he had
the cheek to send me a message that &ldquo;he objected to be
spoken to when accompanying the Governor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door at length opened, and the great man was in the
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; was shrieked out as only
sycophants can do, and duly responded to; and the halt and the
maim, &ldquo;Old Hundred,&rdquo; myself, burglars, and
pickpockets, presented one uninterrupted, swerving, rickety
line.&nbsp; As a spectacle, it must have been truly imposing,
during which the Governor sat down.&nbsp; Our names were then
respectively called out, and we crossed from one bench to another
to show, as it were, our action.&nbsp; Not a muscle of the
inspecting officer&rsquo;s face moved during these scenes in the
arena; and it might have been the Sphinx inspecting the <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>army of
Pharaoh, so little attention did he apparently pay to us.&nbsp;
Nothing, however, had escaped him; and I learnt to believe there
was some truth in the assertion that he had eyes in his boots, if
not in his pockets also.</p>
<p>As may be supposed, these various inspections took a
considerable time, and the day was drawing in before they were
all ended.&nbsp; We were thereupon informed that we should occupy
temporary cells for &ldquo;this night only,&rdquo; and that our
final allotment to various parts of the prison would be postponed
till the morrow.&nbsp; The cell I now found myself in was indeed
a small one&mdash;evidently only used as a half-way house, and
fitted as sparingly as the thermometer one at Newgate.&nbsp; A
notice posted up warned us not to go to bed till the bell rang at
eight; and not wishing to break a rule before I had been in the
place a day, I foolishly complied with the order.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it was getting dark, and though a gaspipe was fitted
into the wall, there was not the slightest indication of its
being likely to be lit.&nbsp; Mike, who had frequently been here
before, intimated his intention of turning in, and, &ldquo;order
be blowed!&rdquo; strongly advised us to do the same.&nbsp; I <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>only regret
I was weak enough not to.&nbsp; The gloom gradually increased
till we were left in outer darkness.&nbsp; To find the
bed-clothing would now have been a difficulty; to make any
resemblance to a bed an absolute impossibility.&nbsp; Still, on
the strength of the notice, I waited through many dark and cold
hours, until a brute with a human voice shouted out from
somewhere, &ldquo;You chaps will get no light to-night, so you
can turn in when you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was informed
afterwards this was a favourite and utterly unauthorized
assumption of authority on the part of this bully, and I trust it
has only to be noticed to preclude the possibility of its
continuance.&nbsp; It was a barbarous and cowardly act, and
strictly opposed to the usual system of the prison.&nbsp; How I
got through that cold night I cannot tell, for bed, bedding and
light were all strangers to me; but night, more merciful than
man, threw its mantle over me, and I slept as sound as only the
weary can.</p>
<h2><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;OAKUM&rdquo; LET US
SING.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning after breakfast we
were drafted to our various localities, and, incredible as it may
appear, and to show how efficient is the isolation system, men
with whom I parted company that morning I never saw again, though
I knew they were in the same building.&nbsp; Our various
destinations were indicated in a somewhat primitive style&mdash;a
huge chalk-mark on our backs.&nbsp; As I threaded my way through
various wards with a C scrawled on my back, a smell of tar
indicated our approach to what might under altered circumstances
have been presumed to be a ship-chandler&rsquo;s; it was,
however, only the oakum district.&nbsp; We were here received by
the warder in command, and I was assigned to the fifth
storey.&nbsp; I was further presented with my official
number&mdash;594, on a brass plate.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>I now
discovered the benefit of &ldquo;light labour and
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This particular ward, together with the two in
its immediate vicinity, is principally devoted to fresh arrivals;
bed is the exception and oakum is the rule.&nbsp; It is
absolutely impossible for any accident to exempt you from
commencing your career for one month in these wards; it rests,
however, with yourself whether you pick oakum or find a
substitute.&nbsp; I decided on the latter course.&nbsp; The
system of prison life is such a contemptible one, and the
espionage, jealousy, currying favour, and tale-bearing so general
between the officials from the highest to the lowest, that this
portion of my task is a very delicate one.&nbsp; Whatever I write
will be carefully sifted; and if I give the slightest clue
capable of being followed up, I should probably injure some
warder, assistant warder, or prisoner who did me incalculable
services at great personal risk; and as this is the last thing I
have the smallest intention of doing, I wish to state, once for
all, that all names and dates I give are intentionally altered,
and that any official who ever befriended me has nothing to fear
from my revelations.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As I ascended the spiral staircase a shout of <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;Coming up!&rdquo; intimated to the attics that a
fresh victim was approaching, and I was formally received and
conducted to my cell.&nbsp; The first impression of my permanent
address was not encouraging.&nbsp; On a shelf was a Bible and
prayer-book, a tin plate, a tin mug, and a tin knife, a wooden
spoon, a box of salt, and a piece of soap, producing a
combination such as may be seen in any of the illustrated papers
during a small war, and supposed to illustrate, as circumstances
require, the utensils in daily use amongst Zulus, Ashantis or
whatever savages we may happen to be slaughtering at the
time.&nbsp; In another corner was a diminutive basin the size of
a saucepan, a slop-pail, and a can of water.&nbsp; On a shelf was
a rug and two blankets; bed or bedstead was conspicuous by its
absence; and on the table was a lump of rope.&nbsp; My turnkey,
having examined my card, ordered in a bed and bedstead, and
explained that the rope was to be converted into oakum.&nbsp; A
few words and we understood one another; in short, he was a man
after my own heart.&nbsp; I have no scruple in mentioning this,
for I regret to say the man was dismissed shortly
after&mdash;through no fault of mine, though indirectly connected
with me.&nbsp; I <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>can never forgive myself when I reflect that I had any
share in the transaction, though it is a consolation to know
that, had he been as careful as he ought, nothing could have
brought the offence home to him.&nbsp; In the first instance, he
was the victim of as foul a piece of treachery as ever disgraced
humanity, and then he lost his head, and compromised himself when
absolute silence would have cleared him.&nbsp; I shall narrate
the particulars later on.&nbsp; In addition to the above-named
furniture, the walls were decorated with a number of printed
notices describing your duties, diet, &amp;c., and a prayer (!);
a wooden&mdash;so much a dozen&mdash;effort, supposed to be
specially adapted to the requirements of &ldquo;awakening
burglars.&rdquo;&nbsp; I learnt all these by heart by way of
amusement, and will give them for the benefit of the
reader.&nbsp; I take especial pleasure in reproducing them, as I
believe they&rsquo;ve never seen daylight before.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>SYSTEM OF PROGRESSIVE STAGES FOR MALE<br />
PRISONERS SENTENCED TO HARD LABOUR.</h3>
<blockquote><p>1.&nbsp; A prisoner shall be able to earn on each
weekday 8, 7, or 6 marks, according to the degree <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>of his
industry; and on Sunday he shall be awarded marks according to
the degree of his industry during the previous week.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There shall be four stages, and every prisoner shall
pass through them or through so much of them as the term of his
imprisonment admits.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; He shall commence in the first stage, and shall
remain in the first stage until he has earned 28 &times; 8, or
224 marks; in the second stage until he has earned 224 more
marks, or 448 in the whole; in the third stage until he has
earned 224 more marks, or 672 in the whole; in the fourth stage
during the remainder of his sentence.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A prisoner whose term of imprisonment is twenty-eight
days or less shall serve the whole of his term in the first
stage.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; A prisoner who is idle, or who misconducts himself,
or is inattentive to instruction, shall be liable</p>
<p>(1) To forfeit gratuity earned or to be earned, or</p>
<p>(2) To forfeit any other stage privileges.</p>
<p>(3) To detention in the stage in which he is until he shall
have earned in that stage an additional number of marks.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>(4)
To degradation to any lower stage (whether such stage is next
below the one in which he is or otherwise) until he has earned in
such lower stage a stated number of marks.</p>
<p>As soon as the prisoner has earned the stated number, then,
unless he has in the meantime incurred further punishment, he
shall be restored to the stage from which he was degraded, and be
credited with the number of marks he had previously earned
therein.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; None of the foregoing punishments shall exempt a
prisoner from any other punishment to which he would be liable
for conduct constituting a breach of prison regulations.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; A prisoner in the first stage will</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Be employed ten hours daily in strict separation on
first class hard labour, of which six to eight hours will be on
crank, tread-wheel, or work of a similar nature.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Sleep on a plank-bed without a mattress.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Earn no gratuity.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; A prisoner in the second stage will</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Be employed as in the first stage until he <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>has
completed one month of imprisonment, and afterwards on hard
labour of the second class.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Sleep on a plank-bed without a mattress two nights
weekly and have a mattress on the other nights.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Receive school instruction.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Have school books in his cell.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Have exercise on Sunday.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Be able to earn a gratuity not exceeding 1s.</p>
<p>(<i>g</i>) The gratuity to a prisoner in this stage, whose
sentence is not long enough for him to earn 224 marks in it, may
be calculated at 1d.&nbsp; for every 20 marks earned.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; A prisoner in the third stage will&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Be employed on second class hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Sleep on a plank-bed without a mattress one night
weekly, and have a mattress on other nights.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Receive school instruction.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Have school books in his cell.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Have library books in his cell.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Have exercise on Sunday.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>(<i>g</i>) Be able to earn a gratuity not exceeding 1s.
6d.</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) The gratuity to a prisoner in this stage, whose
sentence is not long enough for him to earn 224 marks in it, may
be calculated at 1d.&nbsp; for every 12 marks earned.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; A prisoner in the fourth stage will&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Be eligible for employment of trust in the service
of the prison.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Sleep on a Mattress every night.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Receive school instruction.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Have school books in his cell.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Have library books in his cell.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Have exercise on Sunday.</p>

<p>The composition of this abstract, alternating as it does
between threats of punishment and hopes of &ldquo;employments of
trust,&rdquo; clearly stamps it as intended to appeal to the
feelings and adapt itself to the capacities of the lowest
classes.&nbsp; That any man of education could be roused to any
degree of ambition by such &ldquo;trust&rdquo; as would be likely
to be placed in him, is to suppose an impossible absurdity.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;system&rdquo; throttles any such contingency, and
leads&mdash;as all short-sighted policies do&mdash;to men
believing in no such thing as good faith, and having no inward
restraining motive for abstaining from deception.&nbsp; Why will
not the Chief Commissioner of Prisons see that the brute power at
their disposal is wholly inadequate to prevent a man with a
modicum of brains and a few sovereigns from doing as he
pleases?&nbsp; Let them try the &ldquo;confidence trick&rdquo; in
a modified form <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>with the better class of prisoners, and if it is found
to fail, revert to the hard and fast rule.&nbsp; A discretionary
power in the hands of such a man as the Governor of Coldbath
Fields would thoroughly test the experiment.</p>
<p>What trash &ldquo;employment of trust&rdquo; sounds to a man
who knows that from first to last&mdash;however exemplary his
behaviour&mdash;he is suspected, and never supposed to be lost
sight of!</p>
<p>Personally, I felt I&rsquo;d as lief be in the punishment
cells as in any &ldquo;employment of trust&rdquo;; they are both
birds of the same feather, recognizing no code but brute force,
distrust, and degrees of punishment.&nbsp; I can only compare the
prison system to a huge machine, capable of crushing a man body
and soul, or handling him so lightly that nothing but the
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; and its moral obligations remain to remind him
of its hideous proximity.&nbsp; If any further proof is required
of the truth of my deductions, my personal experience will amply
provide it.</p>
<h3>SHORT PRAYERS FOR MORNING AND EVENING.</h3>
<h4><i>Morning</i>.</h4>
<blockquote><p>O <span class="smcap">God</span> and Holy Father,
Thou hast in mercy watched over me through the night; in Thy
tender <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>love keep me this day from evil.&nbsp; I have greatly
sinned against Thee.&nbsp; Do Thou turn me from all my evil ways;
wash me in the blood of Jesus, and let Thy Spirit lead me that I
may hate sin and love what is right.&nbsp; Let Thy grace preserve
me amidst all trials, that I may be made truly a servant of Jesus
Christ and ever love and serve my God and Saviour.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>Evening</i>.</h4>
<blockquote><p>O <span class="smcap">God</span>, Thou hast safely
brought me to the close of another day.&nbsp; May Thy goodness
lead me to repentance that I may give Thee my heart.&nbsp;
Forgive all my evil thoughts, and words, and deeds.&nbsp; What
good thoughts I have had from Thee do Thou strengthen, that I may
love Thee more and serve Thee better.&nbsp; Keep me, O God, and
all whom I love, from danger or sin this night, and so preserve
us by Thy grace that at last we may sleep in Jesus and be for
ever with the Lord.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypocritical effusion hangs over one&rsquo;s table, and
is supposed to be admirably adapted for &ldquo;awakening&rdquo;
burglars, and turning pickpockets from the error of their
ways.&nbsp; As a literary <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>composition it is beneath criticism,
and would disgrace a &ldquo;National School&rdquo; boy in a
proclaimed district.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know who is the inspired
author, nor how they are sold by the dozen.</p>
<h3>NOTICE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Prisoners who desire assistance from the
agent of the Discharged Prisoners&rsquo; Relief Committee, in
finding employment on discharge, should apply to the Governor
fourteen days before they go out, when their cases will be
investigated.&nbsp; Wilfully false statements as to antecedents,
&amp;c., will disqualify a prisoner from assistance, as will also
misconduct in prison.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no institution I heard so much abused as the above,
and although I cannot speak from personal knowledge, I should say
that a thorough enquiry into its working (not its profession)
might possibly be attended with benefit.&nbsp; Beyond seeing a
fly-blown old man waddling about the prison, who, I was informed,
was the agent, I know nothing, and care less, about this
doubtless admirable institution.</p>

<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>A
careful perusal of Dietary 4 will convince the reader that it is
sufficiently generous to obviate any loss of weight, and yet, as
a rule, prisoners fall away on it, (There are some extraordinary
exceptions to this rule, and one man, a gentleman by birth, and
an ex-officer in the army, increased two stone in a few months;
the absolute half-starved vagrant also, of course, fattens on
it.)&nbsp; I can only attribute it to the voracious way they bolt
their food.&nbsp; It is stated of that eminent projector, the
late Mr. Rumford, that he once submitted to the then Elector of
Saxony a scheme whereby he might reduce the expense of
maintaining his army, without impairing its efficiency, by a very
simple method, namely, to reduce the amount, but compel his
soldiers to masticate their food.&nbsp; I cannot say if the
suggestion was acted on, but I am thoroughly convinced that if
prisoners received less, and were compelled to eat slower, a
considerable saving to the state and an improvement in the
appearance of the men would be effected.&nbsp; Personally I found
during the very few weeks I subsisted on this diet that it was
more than I could possibly eat, and withal good.&nbsp; The gruel,
I confess, is an acquired taste, and I was almost <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>immediately
permitted to substitute cocoa.&nbsp; The porridge was also a sad
disappointment.&nbsp; I innocently hoped to have found the
delicious composition associated with the land of cakes and
immortal Burns, and could have burst into tears in recognising it
as intensified gruel.&nbsp; Its nourishing powers, however, are
not to be gainsaid; and to see malefactors shovelling it away, as
I have, one would suppose they enjoyed it.&nbsp; The recitation
of the substitutes for cooked beef I am compelled to characterise
an official quibble.&nbsp; During the few months I spent at
Coldbath I never heard&mdash;as I certainly should&mdash;of any
beef being issued at all, the invariable substitute being
Colonial meat served cold, except on one occasion, when salt fish
was supplied.&nbsp; On the merits of this last item I cannot
speak personally, for long before that I was on a daily diet of
mutton and mutton broth, as I describe hereafter.&nbsp; For the
preserved Colonial meat, however, I have nothing but
praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Served,&rdquo; as it was, under every
disadvantage, I found it excellent; and as it can be purchased
for seven-pence a pound, the marvel is that the poorer classes,
who seldom or never taste butcher&rsquo;s meat, <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>do not
patronise it more largely.&nbsp; I can only suppose its merits
are unknown.</p>
<p>The bedstead, or &ldquo;plank-bed,&rdquo; as it is termed, is
the hardest couch I ever felt; with a mattress on it I could feel
every grain in the wood, and shuddered to think of my companions,
all of whom had to submit for a month to the board &ldquo;pure
and simple.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is only raised three inches from the
floor, and is two feet in breadth&mdash;a tight fit for twenty
stone.&nbsp; I had now fairly settled down in my final
destination for a month, and will describe the routine of the
day:&mdash;</p>

<p>A slight difference existed between the regulation here and at
Newgate on the subject of &ldquo;lights <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>out.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Coldbath it was a serious offence
to retire before 8 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&nbsp; At
Newgate it was, however, optional, though hampered with an absurd
condition.&nbsp; One evening, at this latter awful place, I had
determined on a comfortable read; with this object I undressed
about 7 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>, and, pulling my bed
under the lamp, abandoned myself to the perusal of
<i>Chambers&rsquo; Magazine</i>, for 1878.&nbsp; Barely, however,
had I commenced, when &ldquo;in a moment all was
dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ascertained next morning that it was a rule
to put out the gas as soon as a man got into bed; whether from
economical motives or as an extra mode of annoyance, I never
troubled to ask.</p>
<p>The brown bread, which was often warm from the oven, was as
good as any I have ever tasted, and the quantity enough to
satisfy anyone; and yet the ordinary prisoner would devour his
and gratefully accept as much as anyone else would give
him.&nbsp; I found that prisoners would do anything for food, and
through my entire career I bartered it in exchange for soap,
etc.&nbsp; Amongst other recipients of my bounty was a German Jew
who lived near me.&nbsp; He spoke very little English, and as I
speak German fluently, I often had a <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>word with him.&nbsp; He told me the
usual story about being sentenced for nothing; and though I did
not believe a word of it, it led to his being put on my free
list.&nbsp; A more voracious appetite I never met with, and the
way he bolted half a pound of bread and three or four potatoes
was truly appalling; indeed, so unsatisfactory was it, that I
transferred my patronage after a week; one might as well have
tried to fill Nelson&rsquo;s monument.&nbsp; Giving away food is
strictly prohibited&mdash;a regulation that necessitates certain
precautions, commendable for their suitability rather than their
cleanliness.&nbsp; The usual mode is for the donor to stuff
bread, potatoes, or a lump of suet down his stocking or inside
his shirt, and when time and circumstance permit, to transfer it
to the recipient of his bounty, who in his turn first shoves it
up his back or into his cap, to be transferred at leisure into
the mouth or elsewhere.&nbsp; This manipulation never commended
itself to me; and my rule, though not much more refined, had at
least the advantage of avoiding any personal contact with the
greasy dainties.&nbsp; I placed all my food in my
pocket-handkerchief, and transferred it bodily in exchange for
the others&rsquo;.&nbsp; This rule only applied to the clean
linen day, when I was enabled <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>without delay to get rid of my
brother-reprobate&rsquo;s <i>mouchoir</i>.&nbsp; On other
occasions I received their pocket-handkerchiefs clean, and
returned them later on full of good things.&nbsp; I let it be
understood that I never took a handkerchief unless it was clean;
and so perfect did the system become, that I had only to say
<i>en passant</i>, &ldquo;Your handkerchief to-morrow,&rdquo; and
it was duly handed to me washed and perfectly clean.&nbsp; I only
once was offered a treat of this kind.&nbsp; It was a poor black
man (I often see him about).&nbsp; I watched him fumbling in his
chest and eventually produce a crust; this he secreted for some
minutes in his fist, and then said, &ldquo;Here, master,&rdquo;
and held it out to me.&nbsp; I can see his look of surprise that
followed my refusal; but it was kindly meant, and though I
declined the emetic, I wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt his feelings for
the world.&nbsp; Soup that I didn&rsquo;t consume I usually
placed outside the door, hoping that my regular
&ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; would reach it in time.&nbsp; In this,
however, I was often disappointed, for my custom having got
known, a raid was frequently made on it by others&mdash;a
practice I determined to try and circumvent.</p>
<p>I was suffering at this time from liver complaint, <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>and had on
my shelf a concoction of taraxacum and podophyllin.&nbsp; Of this
I poured one day about two doses into my mutton broth; and as it
was somewhat discoloured by the process, I added half a cup of
soapsuds and a handful of salt.&nbsp; Not long after the two
thieves arrived, and I could distinctly hear their long gulps as
they swallowed the savoury concoction.&nbsp; My commendable
endeavour to break them of pilfering was, however, a complete
failure; and the only remark I overheard was, &ldquo;I say, Bill,
it&rsquo;s damned salt, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soap one received had to last a fortnight, and was not
sufficient for a thorough wash daily and the periodical bath, and
I experienced great inconvenience at first by having to
economize; but when it had got mooted about that there &ldquo;was
a swell as was mug enough to swap grub for soap,&rdquo; my market
became literally glutted, and I was enabled to revel in a bath
every morning.</p>
<p>Washing one&rsquo;s cell floor was not an agreeable
duty.&nbsp; At first I puffed and blew like a grampus, but it
soon became a very simple affair, and I became a perfect adept at
the charwoman business.&nbsp; I heard whilst here, from a
reliable source, of some man who after leaving the prison was
staying at a <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>West-end hotel, and who, seeing a servant shirking her
duty whilst scrubbing the doorstep, and unable to resist the
force of habit, very kindly gave her the benefit of his
experience, and stripping off his coat, proceeded to lay-to
assiduously.&nbsp; I should not hesitate to do the same under
certain circumstances.&nbsp; This &ldquo;doing&rdquo; one&rsquo;s
own apartment was the only derogatory duty I had ever to perform;
and as it was a private show, and clearly for one&rsquo;s own
benefit, I never had the slightest objection to it; the more so
as the taking of my morning bath (the saucepan on the floor) had
half completed the process.</p>
<p>Oakum-picking cannot be called an intellectual
employment.&nbsp; I should say, too, it was decidedly monotonous,
though I can hardly speak from personal experience.&nbsp; I tried
the experiment of unravelling the rope, but it was so intensely
provoking that I turned my thoughts to evading the
necessity.&nbsp; My turnkey and I were friends within twenty-four
hours, and I consulted him about getting a substitute.&nbsp; As
turnkey and prisoner had both left before I had, I may say,
without injuring anyone, that for a weekly consideration my task
was picked daily.&nbsp; Of a morning a bundle was mysteriously <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>thrown into
my cell, and a few moments later I proudly descended with
&ldquo;my work,&rdquo; and dropped the unused rope on the
stair.&nbsp; The usual task that prisoners have to pick is three
pounds a day, but being a light-labour man I was only assigned
one pound.&nbsp; I invariably returned a portion of this modified
amount unpicked, thereby lulling the suspicions of a dense but
offensively-inclined taskmaster.&nbsp; Oakum is one of the most
tell-tale commodities I ever came across.&nbsp; If merely
unravelled, it remains black and juicy; but the more it is picked
and pulled the paler it gets, till it is capable of assuming the
appearance of Turkish tobacco.&nbsp; An experienced eye can at
once detect the amount of labour bestowed on it, and some of the
huge bundles I saw my <i>confr&egrave;res</i> carrying down were
works of art as regards finish.&nbsp; The man who actually picked
my oakum was the &ldquo;cleaner,&rdquo; a privileged individual
with a roving commission.&nbsp; His duties frequently brought him
to my cell, and he told me he was a &ldquo;racing
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; I discovered, however, as we became better
acquainted, that the designation is capable of considerable
expansion, and that his peculiar talent was the &ldquo;three-card
trick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew every racecourse in England as <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>well as
every prison, and never failed of a morning to inquire how I had
slept, adding, that he always slept badly the first few nights in
a strange prison; and my reply that I was not affected in a
&ldquo;similar way&rdquo; appeared to cause him considerable
surprise.&nbsp; In my unravelling process I one day chanced to
come across a bit of cane.&nbsp; It was certainly moist from
proximity to the tar, but I carefully dried and subsequently
smoked it.&nbsp; I can hardly say the pleasure was unalloyed, for
it bore such a resemblance to the fragrant British Havanna that I
got alarmed, and put it out.&nbsp; It was the only smoke I had
for months.</p>
<p>Exercise at Coldbath was an important institution, and
considering it was the only fresh air I at first experienced in
the day, I always looked forward to it.&nbsp; An hour is the
regulation time, but seldom is the boon of that duration; and if
the warder is otherwise engaged, the exercise has to give way,
and thus the prisoner is deprived of a healthy occupation to meet
the convenience of a selfish turnkey.&nbsp; Overlooking the
exercise-yard attached to C ward were a row of houses, and I
often wondered what the lookers-on thought of the moving mass of
misery that circled round below <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>them.&nbsp; To me, with my limited
facilities, there was ample room for reflection; and I often
marvelled how such various types of humanity could have been
collected, or indeed that they ever existed.</p>
<p>One feeble old man particularly attracted my notice.&nbsp; He
was almost unable to walk round from sheer old age, and appeared
altogether incapable of having qualified in any way for lodgings
at Coldbath.&nbsp; I asked a warder what on earth he had
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they say he&rsquo;s a bad
&rsquo;un.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s here for violently assaulting the
police, and got six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t look as if
he would last so long; he must be at least a hundred!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
fact is, a new rule has come in lately, and pauper prisoners are
buried in the prison; so they sent him here in hopes of starting
our new cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another peculiarity that struck me forcibly was the apparently
universal obstruction that appeared to exist in the criminal
throat.&nbsp; It was absolutely epidemic, and the
sounds&mdash;such as are made by an over-wound moderator
lamp&mdash;that accompanied their fruitless endeavours to obtain
relief were excessively revolting.&nbsp; This and the like are
the <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>worst features of coming in contact with these dirty
wretches.&nbsp; Many habits usually looked upon as filthy were
freely indulged in, and anyone who instinctively abstained from
participating was looked upon as an outsider.&nbsp; A foolish
habit I had contracted in my youth of applying my
pocket-handkerchief to its natural use was, I fancy, specially
resented.&nbsp; I could never shake off these feelings, and
though with them, was never &ldquo;one of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
always kept them at arms&rsquo; length, and invariably received
some implied recognition of my superiority.&nbsp; The better
class of prisoners for the most part addressed me as
&ldquo;Capting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;; and even the lowest,
if they spoke&mdash;which I never encouraged&mdash;did so with
some small degree of reserve.&nbsp; The neighbourhood abounds
with street-organs; indeed, it is the head-quarters where the
instrumentalists for the most part live, the consequence being
that, like the lady of Bambury Cross, we had music wherever we
&ldquo;goed.&rdquo;&nbsp; About this time a certain popular air
was much in vogue, and evidently much admired by the criminal
classes.&nbsp; I enquired the name of this vile music-hall ditty,
but without effect; and can only describe it by the fact that no
sooner did it commence than the whole <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>mob appeared to cheer up, and took
up a sort of gin-and-water refrain which they buzzed
out&mdash;&ldquo;Ho moy littul tarling, &rsquo;ow are
yew?&rdquo;&nbsp; The wretch who composed it deserves a
month.&nbsp; It is impossible to describe the monotony of these
days without occupation&mdash;for my deputy did my task&mdash;and
without books.&nbsp; The religious tract, as a leaflet was
officially styled, had to last a fortnight; and I knew by heart
all about &ldquo;The Sweet Recollections of a Sweep,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Converted Charwoman of Goswell Road.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What Pickest Thou, you Wretch?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How are
your Poor Fingers, you Blackguard?&rdquo; were also works
contained in this religious repertoire, and altogether of a more
thrilling description.&nbsp; They were generally understood to
have been the work of a local divine, as indeed their style
suggested.&nbsp; The library books are a very sorry lot, though
probably well adapted to the capacities of their readers.&nbsp;
The rule, too, that permits their change only once a fortnight is
in itself a species of torture unworthy of the system that
sanctions them at all.&nbsp; The type for the most part is large,
and such as an educated man can read in a day.&nbsp; Why, then,
spoil a gracious act by limiting its very innocent scope.&nbsp;
Such, too, <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>is the reckless supervision of these literary treasures
that I received no less than seven school histories of England
during my career.&nbsp; I felt this as almost a reflection on the
Dean of W&mdash; and my classical education generally.</p>
<p>There was, however, a reserve library for the special benefit
of the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; minded, and men of education with
strict Episcopalian proclivities.&nbsp; This issue, and its
attendant patronage, is vested entirely in the hands of the
chaplain&mdash;a custom it is high time to alter&mdash;and
considering I had never been confirmed, it is a marvel how I was
ever included in its favoured ranks.&nbsp; The blessing was not,
however, an entirely unmitigated one; and &ldquo;Locke&rsquo;s
Essay on the Mind,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Theory of Sturm,&rdquo; and
such light reading usually fell to my share.&nbsp; Happily I was
independent of it all, although an amusing and undignified
squabble some months later deprived me of even this modified
clerical patronage.</p>
<p>I must mention one incident connected with my &ldquo;three
card&rdquo; acquaintance before leaving the oakum district.&nbsp;
It was after chapel, and he was in my cell, when, after sundry
enquiries as to how I liked the service, etc., he said&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;I calls it bad, very bad taste, the way they
goes on, even in chapel, at a chap about his work.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you hear this morning about the oakum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oakum,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember any
allusion to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes you do,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mind my nudging you?&rdquo; and then I
recollected receiving a dig in the ribs, which I failed to
understand at the time, as they began to sing, &ldquo;O Come, let
us sing,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; The racing man had made a mistake in
the spelling, and very properly resented the allusion.</p>
<p>My transfer from this hateful district was, however, nearer
than I supposed, and an unexpected occurrence a few days after my
arrival brought about this welcome change.&nbsp; My door was one
day suddenly opened, and my friend the turnkey appeared in
breathless agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summat&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; he jerked out; &ldquo;mind
you tells em nothink.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to be transferred
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE VISITING JUSTICES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> was indeed up; a letter,
in fact, that I had clandestinely written had been
intercepted.&nbsp; Personally I was indifferent to the result;
the worst had been done to me when I found myself in
prison.&nbsp; Degrees of punishment had no terrors for me, and I
was equally callous as to whether employed in a &ldquo;situation
of trust&rdquo; or languishing in a punishment cell.&nbsp; To me
all appeared tarred with the same brush, and I loathed the
privileges and punishments, the indulgences and deprivations, the
spiritual comforts, and every other contingency with the same
intensity.&nbsp; As regards the turnkey, however, my sympathy was
enlisted.&nbsp; Here was a poor man, with a wife and family,
liable to dismissal, and even imprisonment, if convicted of
carrying letters.&nbsp; At the time I was at a loss to understand
how the traffic could <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>possibly have been discovered.&nbsp;
I was confident I had not been observed writing, and had seen the
letters securely secreted in the warder&rsquo;s pouch.&nbsp;
Unless, then, he had been guilty of some indiscretion, the
discovery seemed impossible.&nbsp; Such a contingency as foul
play from without never entered my head, and yet, alas, such a
thing had actually occurred.&nbsp; A servant in the family of one
of my correspondents had lately been detected in a series of
systematic thefts from her employers, extending over many
months.&nbsp; The discovery naturally involved her immediate
dismissal, and by way of gratitude for their refraining from
prosecuting her, she purloined my letter, and assuming a position
of authority, called at the prison and produced the
document.&nbsp; Her motive was clearly revenge, but the truth (as
it always does) eventually came out, and the mystery that
shrouded the transaction for months has happily been dispelled,
and the temporary doubt (almost excusable) that associated the
act with very dear friends has given way to a regret that I could
ever have doubted their honour.&nbsp; As to the thieving,
sneaking wretch, she decamped with her spoils; and though her
photograph has been <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>freely distributed in the
&ldquo;three ball&rdquo; quarter, she has hitherto evaded
discovery.&nbsp; For my part I would gladly subscribe a trifle
for the present address of Mrs. Smith.&nbsp; With the mystery
that surrounded everything that occurred in the place, I tried in
vain to ascertain whether anything had really been discovered,
but day after day passed, and the affair had apparently blown
over.&nbsp; This, however, was an erroneous impression; it was
only the lull that precedes the storm, and not a stone was being
left unturned to sift the matter.&nbsp; The turnkey, at the time
only suspected of complicity in the matter, was carefully
watched.&nbsp; When he left of an evening his every footstep was
dogged, and a nightly report of his rambles duly made.&nbsp; A
letter, too, that he foolishly posted in a neighbouring
pillar-box pointed indirectly to his connivance, and subsequent
inquiries at the district receiving office made matters possibly
clearer.&nbsp; A close relationship exists between such
Government institutions as post-offices, prisons, and
police-stations, which affords greater facilities to constituted
authorities for unearthing mysteries than to ordinary
mortals.&nbsp; I was ignorant in those days of this affinity, and
an easy prey to such trumpery contingencies; but <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>I
eventually reduced the trafficking to a science impossible of
detection, and unfailing in its results.&nbsp; Can it be wondered
at&mdash;surrounded as one is by underpaid officials, who begin
at twenty-one shillings and twenty-three shillings a week, with a
gradual increase, after years of toil, to a possible twenty-eight
shillings, and with a prospect, after twenty years&rsquo;
service, of receiving a pension of ten shillings a week&mdash;can
it be wondered at, I ask, that these worthy men are unable to
resist a bribe?&nbsp; I should regret to have to prove my words,
but if I was in the position again, I think I could undertake to
be in daily communication with the outer world, despite bolts and
bars and the &ldquo;special&rdquo; observation I was always
subject to.&nbsp; This is no idle boast, as subsequent events
will prove; and the authorities have only themselves to thank for
exercising no discretionary power in their treatment of
prisoners, when the facts I mention prove conclusively that a
great difference does exist and always will between the vagrant
and the gentleman, even in prison, in more ways than one.&nbsp;
The underpaid turnkey is still more unfairly handicapped, and it
resolves itself into his choosing between my &pound;5 and the
Government &pound;1.&nbsp; What <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>more natural than that he should
elect the former, when the most ordinary precaution will guard
against detection.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the authorities
ought to begrudge the so-called gentleman this solitary
advantage.&nbsp; No one can deny that six months to a man of
education is an infinitely severer trial than eighteen to a
costermonger.&nbsp; The one has to battle with the mind,
conscience, remorse, shattered prospects, loss of caste, a
blighted future, food, clothing, surroundings, all inferior to
what he has been accustomed to; to submit, moreover, to be
addressed by inferiors in a tone of authority, besides a
hundred-and-one other humiliations impossible to remember: the
other finds himself amongst friends, loses nothing by his
incarceration, is better clothed, fed, and housed than if he were
at home, and, in the case of an artizan, reverts to his every-day
employment; and yet this is seldom taken into consideration, and
justice is ladled out to gentleman and vagrant alike.&nbsp; I
cannot assert this as my own experience, for justice was indeed
tempered with mercy to me, and I am fully sensible of the
consideration I received, both at my trial and hereafter.&nbsp;
Under ordinary circumstances one would be accused of ingratitude
for <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>breaking rules and deceiving those in authority who had
treated one well, but I never took this personal view of
it.&nbsp; I was fighting a system that I despised, not
individuals that I respected.&nbsp; So I looked on it as a game
of &ldquo;brag,&rdquo; a kind of &ldquo;French and
English,&rdquo; a question of bolts and bars <i>versus</i>
brains, where the latter had apparently the worst of it, where
undue importance was attached to watching and spying, and nothing
left to one&rsquo;s parole.&nbsp; About a week after my transfer
(I was now in the needlework ward, and being initiated into the
mysteries of darning stockings) I received a summons to appear
before the Governor.&nbsp; I knew now that the letter-writing had
been discovered, or, as my friend the turnkey had expressed it,
&ldquo;Summat was up.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told me, in a few words,
that it had come to his knowledge that I had been sending out
clandestine letters, and requested me to inform him if that was
the case, and who had been my channel of communication, adding
that he was prepared to take down any statements I might feel
disposed to make.&nbsp; The idea of denying it never entered my
head&mdash;I was perfectly indifferent as to what might happen; I
thereupon informed him that I had <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>written, as he alleged, three
letters, and that I was quite prepared to bear the
consequences.&nbsp; I, however, respectfully declined to give him
any information as to my <i>employ&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; I was then
requested to wait outside, and the order was given to send for
Mr. B&mdash;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;if poor
old B&mdash; tells them as much as I have he need not fear being
identified as my brother conspirator.&rdquo;&nbsp; A moment
later, and I was recalled: a glance at the unhappy B&mdash;
convinced me that fear had robbed him of his self-possession, and
that he had not observed the salutary advice he had given me as
to &ldquo;telling &rsquo;em nothink.&rdquo;&nbsp; His face was
the colour of a boiled turkey, and the keys at his side (a sorry
burlesque on authority) were rattling from tremour.&nbsp; The
Governor then said, &ldquo;Mr. B&mdash; has admitted that he took
a letter for you, so I presume you have now no objection to admit
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In courtesy to the nervous donkey I asked him if
that was correct, and on his replying in the affirmative, I at
once made a clean breast of it.&nbsp; The poor man was thereupon
suspended from duty, and a week later summarily dismissed.&nbsp;
I tried to make him every reparation in my power, and shortly
after I procured him a billet at thirty <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>shillings a
week, but when I sent to his lodgings I found he had left.&nbsp;
I heard afterwards he had gone into the country, where I hope by
this time he has recovered his position.&nbsp; My case had yet to
be dealt with, and as the Governor was not qualified to
adjudicate on such a serious offence as this is considered, I was
remanded to appear before the Visiting Justices.&nbsp; I heard
terrible rumours of these avenging Solons, and of the floggings,
solitary confinements, and other barbarities that followed in the
wake of their fortnightly visits, and was prepared&mdash;but
perfectly indifferent&mdash;for the worst.&nbsp; My information
for the most part was derived from brother malefactors, and
consequently likely to be considerably exaggerated.&nbsp; I
found, indeed, that this was the case, and when the eventful
day&mdash;Black Wednesday&mdash;arrived, I discovered that the
dreaded justices were a full bench of Middlesex magistrates, my
old friends who had smashed, pulverized, and otherwise
annihilated Barnabas Amos on my representations, and who I hoped
and believed were gentlemen capable of weighing the pros and cons
of my peculiar case.&nbsp; My expectations were more than
verified.&nbsp; The punishment cells, as I had had them
described, <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>and of which I hereafter got a bird&rsquo;s-eye
view&mdash;<i>from outside</i>&mdash;were not inviting
abodes.&nbsp; There are twelve of them, fitted with double doors,
warranted to preclude all sound from penetrating beyond.&nbsp;
They contain no furniture, except a plank and a stool, both fixed
to the floor, and the two blankets and rug that constitute the
entire bed and bedding are issued every night and removed every
morning.&nbsp; Water is supplied three times a day, and the food
is stirabout and dry bread, administered on homoeopathic
principles.&nbsp; Books there are none&mdash;indeed, the subdued
light would make them superfluous; the occupants, moreover, have
no employment, the distraction of oakum-picking even being
fiendishly denied them.&nbsp; Men who had undergone this
punishment told me that the effect was indescribable, this
combination of gloom, idleness, and profound silence, and their
wasted appearance after a fortnight&rsquo;s incarceration fully
confirmed their assertions.&nbsp; The penalty, as I was credibly
informed, for sending a letter out was ten days at least in the
punishment cells; and a preliminary I underwent of being
carefully weighed on the morning of the eventful day raised the
betting in my estimation to six to four on <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the
cells.&nbsp; A kind friend expressed great sympathy for me, but
feared I must make up my mind to this degrading punishment.&nbsp;
But he was wrong; the weighing was superfluous, and I got off
with a reprimand.</p>
<p>The Middlesex magistrates having heard the case, which was put
before them in the kindest light by the Governor, and taking into
consideration the dastardly act, whereby the offence was in a
measure discovered, informed me through the chairman that they
knew my position and were sorry for it, pointed out the gravity
of my offence, and finished with an admonition&mdash;a treatment
that only gentlemen could have accorded to such as I.&nbsp; This
generosity induced me to register a mental vow that I would not
abuse their kindness.&nbsp; I felt indeed as if I were on my
parole; but the foolish act of an illiterate
jailor&mdash;instigated, I suspect, by a vindictive snob&mdash;a
few days after, armed with the authority, but incapable of
discriminating between the treatment most likely to be deterrent
to a man like myself and that desirable with a costermonger,
turned me from my good resolutions.&nbsp; I saw it was a question
of the &ldquo;best man wins,&rdquo; that confidence was a thing
that <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>never entered their heads, and that I had nothing to
gain by passive submission.&nbsp; For the first and only time in
my career I felt insulted, and determined henceforth to double my
precautions, to evade every regulation, and to lose no
opportunity of bribing everything and everybody with whom I came
in contact.&nbsp; The act that decided me in this course was
being formally searched.&nbsp; A few days after my admonition I
was unexpectedly visited by two warders, and ordered to change
everything I had on for a fresh supply, which they brought
in.&nbsp; Meanwhile my cell was turned upside down.&nbsp; The
salt was capsized into the plate; my bed minutely examined; the
table and stool tapped and shaken; and matches struck and poked
down the ventilators; and when they discovered I had neither
pencil nor paper, I was left to readjust my apartment.&nbsp; As I
said to them at the time, nobody in his senses would have
supposed that a man who had so lately escaped a severe punishment
would be such a fool as to incur the risk of possessing
contraband articles.&nbsp; As a fact, I had got rid of all my
combustibles a few days before; and if any of the officials can
remember a stoppage in a certain drain about that time, they can
make a pretty <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>shrewd guess at what became of them.&nbsp; The above
incident may, I hope, attract the notice of someone in authority,
and be the means of giving a discretionary power to governors of
prisons as regards the treatment of a certain class of
prisoners.&nbsp; Sauce for the goose is not always sauce for the
gander, and it&rsquo;s for the authorities to decide whether
certain results cannot be attained by tact that can never be
assured by brutality.</p>

203</span>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PRISON TRADES.</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">great</span> variety of trades are
represented in Coldbath Fields&mdash;such as tailors, shoemakers,
blacksmiths, tinsmiths, worsted-workers, laundrymen, bakers,
needlemen, basket-makers, mat-makers, printers, bookbinders,
carpenters, plumbers, and glaziers.&nbsp; Of these mat-making and
laundry-work are considered the hardest.&nbsp; The men selected
for following any of the above vocations are looked upon as
privileged individuals, and infinitely better off than the
ordinary oakum-picker&mdash;a task that everyone has to submit to
for one month, although many never get beyond it and its
accompanying isolation during the two years of their
imprisonment.&nbsp; A good deal of the comfort or otherwise with
which these trades are followed depends on the warders in
charge.&nbsp; If the warder is a brute, the prisoners become
demoralized, crime is rampant, and reports <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>and
punishment the natural consequence.&nbsp; If he happens to be
reasonable and just in his dealings, contentment reigns, the work
is well done, and insubordination is unknown.&nbsp; I saw and
heard a great deal in support of this assertion, and during my
few months&rsquo; retirement managed to poke my nose into a good
many queer corners.&nbsp; The laundry bears an unenviable
notoriety, both on account of the excessive hard labour and the
brutality with which it is enforced.&nbsp; There are about sixty
men employed in this department, who have severally to wash one
or other of the following quantities daily:&mdash;30 shirts, 80
sheets, 200 towels, 500 pocket-handkerchiefs, 18 blankets, 250
pairs of socks.&nbsp; Such quantities would tax the capacity of
an expert washerwoman; but when a novice&mdash;probably a clerk
or respectable tradesman&mdash;is put to the task, its magnitude
is at first insurmountable.&nbsp; Instead of 30 shirts, the poor
wretch finds he cannot manage more than 5, which next day he
succeeds in bringing up to 15.&nbsp; Meanwhile his hands become
chafed and sore, and he sees the doctor in hopes of getting
relief; but the doctor is powerless.&nbsp; A cut finger is not a
serious complaint though probably a very painful one; and he has
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>no
alternative but to send him back.&nbsp; This in itself is
considered as malingering; and the poor devil is brought before
the Governor for idleness and feigning sickness, and is sentenced
to one day&rsquo;s bread and water as a first offence.&nbsp;
Should this &ldquo;crime&rdquo; be repeated, he gets an increased
punishment, and is either flogged or sent to the punishment
cells.&nbsp; This is no overcoloured description.&nbsp; A
prisoner in such a case has neither justice nor any means of
proving the injustice.&nbsp; Any report, however garbled, is
necessarily believed; and if corroboration is necessary, a dozen
turnkeys, from every part of the prison, will come forward, and
emphatically endorse their comrade&rsquo;s charge.&nbsp; The
prisoner meanwhile is not allowed to speak, and if he did would
not be believed, and, as often happens with the lower classes, is
actuated by fear, which only increases his apparent guilt.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is not the prison authorities that can be held responsible
for this burlesque on justice, for more humane, honourable, and
just men than the Governor and Surgeon of Coldbath Fields do not
exist.&nbsp; It is the vile system that gives no discretionary
power to these officials, and considers that a man once overtaken
in a fault ought forthwith <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>to be treated like a dog; and, not
satisfied with this inhuman conclusion, deputes the carrying out
of their system to a set of ignorant, cringing, underpaid warders
and turnkeys&mdash;in many cases ill-conditioned by nature, and
brutal, eye-serving, and untrustworthy by habit.</p>
<p>One victim of this cruel system, that was undergoing fifteen
months&rsquo; imprisonment, worn out by work, constant reports,
punishment, and illness, and who was refused permission to revert
to oakum-picking in preference to remaining in the laundry, went
back to his solitary cell one Saturday night, and in sheer
desperation hanged himself; and Sunday morning found him
suspended by his bed-straps from the bell-handle, cold and stone
dead.&nbsp; Another lad of 18, who had been reported for talking,
and sentenced to bread and water, took it so much to heart that
on his cell door being opened about 2 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span> he rushed past the turnkey, and
threw himself over the railings.&nbsp; He was picked up
insensible and taken to the hospital, when, incredible as it may
appear, he was found to be absolutely uninjured, although he had
jumped from a fifth storey and landed on a stone floor.&nbsp; On
his dinner tin the unhappy youth had <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>scratched, &ldquo;Dear father and
mother, brothers and sisters I wish you all good-bye and have 3
days cells and 3 days bread and water and pushed about.&nbsp;
From A. Burke.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lad was thereupon brought before
the visiting justices, and in consideration of his youth only got
seven days in the punishment cells.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that great malingering and deception are
practised by prisoners, which necessitates the greatest vigilance
on the part of the officials.&nbsp; Nothing is commoner than for
them to pretend attempted suicide; and instances are of frequent
occurrence where a man, having calculated the time to a nicety,
proceeds to hang himself as his door is being opened.&nbsp; These
gentlemen are almost invariably flogged.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is equally certain that justice is not
meted out in the disposal of everyday offences.&nbsp; Discipline
demands that the warders must be supported; and even if they are
known to be lying or grossly exaggerating, &ldquo;the
system&rdquo; necessitates their being believed.&nbsp; If,
therefore, this humble stratum of humanity is supposed to be
entitled to a particle of fair play, it calls for the immediate
attention of Sir Edmund Du Cane.&nbsp; I <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>would
suggest the advisability of an experienced <i>ex parte</i>
official being daily present at these orderly-room farces, who
could watch the cases and weigh the evidence.&nbsp; Until this is
done a prisoner has about as much prospect of justice as had
Arabi before the arrival of Mr. Broadley.&nbsp; In this
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of justice as administered at
Coldbath Fields I must be permitted to disown all reflections on
the Governor, for whom I have the profoundest respect.&nbsp; It
is the system that I blame, and sympathize with a conscientious
man being compelled by regulation to conform to its usages.</p>
<p>About eighty men are employed as tailors; of these the best
workmen are employed in the shop, the remainder doing piecework
in their respective cells.&nbsp; They make the entire clothing
for officers and prisoners for this and many other prisons.&nbsp;
The work is exceptionally good&mdash;a fact not to be wondered
at, considering they count amongst their ranks journeymen and
cutters from many of the principal West-end houses.&nbsp; The
basket-making is exceptionally good, and to a great extent made
to the order of the leading shops; and the specimens of neat work
I have seen quite surprised me.&nbsp; Mat-making is a severe type
of hard labour.&nbsp; The <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>daily task is one yard, and men who
have been employed at it have assured me that it is very hard
work.&nbsp; The mat-room is fitted with twelve looms for the make
of the best doormats.&nbsp; The Government has a contract with
Treloar, a shopkeeper in Ludgate; and as he is supposed to have a
large connection, it may be assumed that reputedly honest feet
are constantly being brought into contact with the work of
dishonest hands.</p>
<p>The bakery is worth a visit, if only to see the mountains of
bread in course of preparation.&nbsp; In this place about
twenty-four men are constantly employed putting in or taking out
loaves from two huge ovens.&nbsp; All the bread, whether white or
brown, is made in separate loaves of the average size of a penny
roll; and when it is added that some 4000 of these are consumed
daily, representing a gross weight of over half a ton, in
Coldbath Fields alone (to say nothing of Holloway Gaol and the
House of Detention, which are also supplied from here), some idea
of the proportions of &ldquo;our bakery&rdquo; may be arrived
at.&nbsp; The kitchen is, if anything, still more
interesting.&nbsp; I have never seen anything to approach the
size of the vats and utensils, unless, perhaps, in a pantomime
scene <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>representing Gorgeybuster the giant&rsquo;s
<i>cuisine</i>.&nbsp; Everything is here cooked by steam, and
excellent the cookery is.&nbsp; The soup, which is supplied three
times a week, is exceptionally good.&nbsp; It finds its way from
the kitchen in enormous tubs, and on arrival at the various wards
is transferred into greasy, half-washed tins; still it does not
lose its excellence, and I invariably enjoyed the soup.&nbsp; The
usual amount made on soup days is about 200 gallons, and the
daily quantity of potatoes consumed about 7 cwt.&nbsp; As may be
supposed, certain farces and abuses have crept into this
department.&nbsp; Specimens of the cookery are daily laid out for
the inspection of the surgeon and Governor.&nbsp; If they should,
however, omit this essential form, it is amply compensated for by
the voracity of some of the head warders, who frequently
sacrifice inclination at the shrine of duty and make a
substantial meal during the tasting process.&nbsp; Beef-tea for
the use of the patients is also made here&mdash;a brew that would
be considerably strengthened by being doctored in the hospital
kitchen instead of where it is.&nbsp; A pound of beef is the
liberal allowance for each pint of beef-tea.&nbsp; The usual
custom that prevails, however, is for the <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>beef to be
eaten, by those who ought to know better, and for Colonial meat
to be substituted for it.&nbsp; I assert this advisedly, and
offer it as the possible solution of the knotty problem of why
complaints are of such frequent occurrence.&nbsp; Home Office
papers, please copy!&nbsp; Despite all the assertions to the
contrary, I freely confess I never found fault with the prison
fare; and if one could keep one&rsquo;s thoughts from wandering
to &ldquo;Bignon&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Caf&eacute;
Helder,&rdquo; one could thoroughly enjoy the liberal fare.&nbsp;
I experienced this dietary, pure and simple, for two or three
months, so may be fairly considered capable of forming an
opinion.</p>
<p>The carpenters&rsquo; and smiths&rsquo; shops call for no
special notice beyond the custom in vogue, whereby all men are
carefully searched before returning to their cells.&nbsp; This
is, no doubt, an essential ceremony, as turnkeys&rsquo;
scalping-knives, in the shape of chisels, might occasionally go
astray, not forgetting the modest pencil, the most treasured
possession of Her Majesty&rsquo;s prisoners.</p>
<p>The oakum shed finds employment for about a dozen men.&nbsp;
In it piles of old rope are being continually chopped up,
weighed, and tied into bundles varying from one to three pounds
in weight.&nbsp; I <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>have often seen van loads of this apparently worthless
rope discharging cargo at this shed, and was surprised to see the
same though quite unrecognisable rope leaving the prison a week
or two after converted into the finest oakum, to be again
utilized for the manufacture of rope.</p>
<p>The paper room is the most original and interesting of the
various institutions in this original and interesting
place.&nbsp; I do not know if it lies in the route through which
visitors are conducted, but if it does it will repay a minute
inspection.&nbsp; Into this room the sweepings of the Houses of
Parliament and the various Government Offices in the United
Kingdom find their way.&nbsp; All old telegrams, after being kept
six months at the General Post Office, are sent here to be
destroyed, to say nothing of old ledgers, directories, blue
books, almanacks, etc.; in short, a heterogeneous mass of things
useful and things useless, all higgle-de-piggledy, to be sorted
and torn into small pieces, and eventually converted into paper
by Alderman Waterlow and his sons (these last named individuals
do their share of the work at home).&nbsp; Amongst this pile the
most valuable discoveries are of daily occurrence; and articles
priceless in <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>the estimation of a prisoner, such as pen-knives, boxes
of cigarettes, butt-ends of cigars, writing paper, envelopes,
novels, coins, pencils, and postage stamps, are hourly
exhumed.&nbsp; About 200 men are employed in this department,
whose duty is to tear up into small atoms a certain amount of
waste paper daily.&nbsp; Of the above number some 20 of the most
trustworthy (<i>i.e.</i>, those who are the greatest adepts in
the art of secreting property about their persons) are employed
in overhauling the supply, and delivering up contraband
goods&mdash;that they may not require&mdash;before passing it to
be manipulated by their less trustworthy
<i>confr&egrave;res</i>.&nbsp; Great precautions are supposed to
be taken against the possibility of a prisoner appropriating any
of this &ldquo;treasure trove,&rdquo; and they are each and all
subjected to a minute examination before returning to their
cells.&nbsp; That this search meets all the requirements of the
case may be gleaned from the quantities of things that find their
way into the prison.&nbsp; I was never without a capital
pen-knife, and when I lost mine (or when it was stolen), as I did
on more than one occasion, I never had any difficulty in
procuring another.&nbsp; The stationery that I used for my
&ldquo;private&rdquo; correspondence was <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>invariably
House of Commons paper, and, excepting perhaps being almost
imperceptibly soiled, was as good as new.&nbsp; The traffic in
tobacco through this agency is by no means inconsiderable, and
before I had made my personal arrangements for a weekly supply I
have frequently exchanged food for cigarettes; but they were far
from satisfactory, and I found them infinitely better adapted for
choking than chewing.&nbsp; Butt-ends of cigars, too, find a
ready market; but at this point I invariably drew the line, and
preferred&mdash;inveterate smoker though I am&mdash;to forego the
luxury of chewing a cigar that had been half-masticated by some
scorbutic quill-driver.&nbsp; The special trade that I was put to
was worsted work.&nbsp; I was officially described as a
&ldquo;needleman,&rdquo; a title I had more claim to than may
appear at first sight.&nbsp; Needlemen are employed either in
knitting stockings, making shirts, or darning blankets, shirts,
or socks.&nbsp; I had the choice of any of these delectable
pursuits, and selected the latter as the most easy of
evasion.&nbsp; Darning burglars&rsquo; stockings, I admit, sounds
a humble and unsavoury vocation; but considering they are boiled
for about three days before passing into the needlemen&rsquo;s
hands, any antipathy on the <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>subject must be attributed to sheer
prejudice.&nbsp; Other motives also influenced me; it was far the
lightest and most elastic job, and a reserve bundle I always kept
in stock did me good service on the thimble rig principle.&nbsp;
The allotted task was 15 pair a day <i>at least</i>, but thanks
to my &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; (a far greater success than Mr.
Cardwell&rsquo;s), and &ldquo;auxiliaries&rdquo; of other kinds,
I found that two pair and sometimes three a day met all the
&ldquo;requirements of the service.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nature of my
work amusingly exemplified Locke&rsquo;s theory of the
&ldquo;Association of Ideas,&rdquo; and I never took up a
stocking without having vividly presented to my mind the scene in
&ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; where Marguerite is <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>bound to
lame the wearer.&nbsp; I speak from personal knowledge, for one
afternoon I experimentalized with one of my specimen repairs and
blistered my foot for a month.&nbsp; I often had qualms of
conscience as I saw the numerous men that were limping round at
exercise&mdash;the number of whom appeared to increase in
proportion to the quantity of stockings I darned&mdash;and I
could not help feeling that I was the unintentional cause of all
this misery.&nbsp; My deplorable incapacity in the Berlin wool
and fancy line was once nearly getting me into a terrible
scrape.&nbsp; Amongst the pedestrians that exercised at the same
time as myself was an ex-convict and desperado, who prided
himself on the recital of his past experiences, and who had
undergone penal servitude in Australia and England almost without
interruption during the past 20 years.&nbsp; He was a Hercules in
appearance, addicted to the use of his fists on the slightest
provocation, and about the last man whose susceptibilities one
would care to offend.&nbsp; On his arrival some twelve months
previously he had laid down some wholesome rules for the guidance
of those whom it might concern.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wants
any &rsquo;umbug as long as I&rsquo;m
&rsquo;ere&rdquo;&mdash;this was the burthen <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>of his
instructions.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my work as well as
I&rsquo;m able, and you&rsquo;ll allus find me willing and
respec&rsquo;ful-like; but if any of you attempts to bully or
&rsquo;umbug me I&rsquo;ll cut your throats from ear to
ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conceive, then, my feelings on seeing this
amiable creature one morning struggling with his stocking.&nbsp;
A glance convinced me it was my handiwork.&nbsp; With a terrible
oath, and livid with rage, he expressed a wish that he only knew
the chap that had &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; his stocking.&nbsp; With an
equally fervent but inaudible prayer I sincerely hoped he never
would.</p>
<h2><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE OUTER WORLD.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> unfortunate <i>contretemps</i>
that had indirectly associated me with the dismissal of a warder
caused me to be looked upon for some time by his
<i>confr&egrave;res</i> with considerable distrust; it was
generally understood, however, that I was not a man that could be
bullied with impunity, and would unhesitatingly have reported any
attempt of the kind.&nbsp; I attribute this diagnosis of my
character to my bearing from the first.&nbsp; I made it a rule to
be scrupulously courteous to the humblest turnkey if he showed an
inclination to treat me civilly, whilst I ignored the position of
those who attempted to hector over me, and convinced them by my
manner that I looked on them as my inferiors.&nbsp; When I
reflect on the bearing of the various officials towards other
prisoners, I am at a loss to understand how I was permitted the
latitude I was.&nbsp; <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>I can only attribute it to that
moral and indefinable effect certain men of birth and education,
and naturally arrogant in disposition, do and always will
exercise, no matter how temporarily circumstanced, over their
inferiors.&nbsp; This bearing asserted itself without my
knowledge, and I had my likes and dislikes from the highest to
the lowest.&nbsp; Thus I liked and respected the Governor, and
ignored his deputy; I liked one chaplain, and cordially despised
the other; I liked and venerated the kind old surgeon, which
would be exaggerating my feelings regarding his assistant.&nbsp;
None of my antipathies could probably instance any absolute case
against me, yet they were respectively aware of my estimate of
their merits.&nbsp; To remove this feeling of distrust amongst
the turnkeys was by no means easy.&nbsp; I had to watch my
opportunity to get into conversation, and then carefully to
smuggle in &ldquo;a word in season.&rdquo;&nbsp; This necessary
formula was not unattended with risk, and I had to discover the
disposition of my man and not say the wrong word in the wrong
place.&nbsp; My knowledge of human nature gave me a considerable
advantage in these negotiations; it was like playing
blind-man&rsquo;s-buff with one eye exposed, <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>and I soon
had the measure of every official in the prison.&nbsp; Some nuts
I admit to have found very difficult to crack, but they
eventually yielded to treatment; others were hopeless cases, and
some I labelled &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; and carefully
avoided.&nbsp; I had, however, attained my object; and wherever I
went, or wherever I was located, I was always within
&ldquo;measurable distance&rdquo; of one ministering angel, and
often two.&nbsp; The principal cause of my unbroken success may
be attributed to my having no confidants&mdash;my right hand
literally knew not what my left was doing; and Jones, the
turnkey, who lived in fear and trembling that Brown would suspect
his trafficking with me, was a source of hourly anxiety to Brown,
who dreaded Jones getting wind of his kindly interest in my
affairs.&nbsp; I always assured these respective worthies that
they had nothing to fear from me if they would only exercise
ordinary discretion on their own parts, and as I was above the
weakness of carrying about a fagot of pencils or cigars, it is
hardly to be wondered at that diplomacy triumphed.&nbsp; Through
one channel or another I heard everything that was going on, and
was on more than one occasion amused by having repeated to me <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>the special
cautions that were issued regarding me.&nbsp; The Deputy Governor
was no friend of mine; indeed I should be doing him an injustice
if I omitted to state that he disliked me as cordially as I did
him.&nbsp; He was of that pronounced military type associated in
my mind with the Fifth West Indian Regiment, and suggested the
idea of having been promoted from the adjutantcy of that
distinguished corps to a company in a non-purchase regiment
during the Cardwellite era.&nbsp; A switch, and an almost
brimless pot hat, worn on one side, completed the picture of this
typical sabreur.&nbsp; He apparently took a considerable interest
in my affairs, and frequently asked questions, and gave wholesome
advice to the turnkeys regarding their intercourse with me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have nothing to do with that man&rdquo; was the burthen of
his song, all of which was invariably repeated to me.&nbsp; His
duties assimilated very much with those of a garrison
Quarter-master, and he was supposed to poke about and discover
dirt in impossible places; occasionally, however, they resembled
those of a boatswain in H.M. navy; as, for example, at the
flogging of garrotters, and the birching of little boys, when he
counted the <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>strokes.&nbsp; I had to be careful of this individual,
for I am confident he had his suspicions about my little games;
but it was the old story of the ironclad charging the outrigger,
and with all the facilities at his disposal he was no match for
me in a matter of finesse.&nbsp; To such a state of perfection
had I now brought my arrangements, that everything of interest
was at once known to me; and the hanging of Dr. Lamson, Prince
Leopold&rsquo;s wedding, and the bombardment of Alexandria, all
assisted in their turn to relieve the monotony of my
existence.&nbsp; Nor was my system confined to gloomy
Clerkenwell; but penetrated into the sanctity of the more
fashionable Belgravia; and conversations of peculiar interest to
me, that took place at table or in the privacy of the closet, and
that I had a motive for hearing, were repeated to me within a day
with a minuteness of detail that would astonish the
gossipers.&nbsp; This is no idle boast, as documents and dates in
my possession can and may testify.&nbsp; In short I was in
telephonic communication with the outer world (registered number
594).&nbsp; But a master hand was required to keep this huge
machinery in order, which, no sooner was it removed, than it
crumbled <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>to pieces.&nbsp; Within a week after my final
departure, papers began to be picked up, and a scientific
elaboration, incapable of detection, was degraded to the level
and shared the same fate as the commonest pickpocket&rsquo;s
ruse.&nbsp; The moral that is to be gleaned from all this is: If
you wish a thing done <i>well</i>, do it yourself.&nbsp; I trust
the sequel to my departure above narrated may afford a melancholy
satisfaction to those interested, and convince them that no extra
precautions are necessary to prevent the repetition of these
innovations; the rules in force are amply sufficient for the
ordinary prisoner.&nbsp; But my constitution, suffering from this
severe strain, and assisted considerably by fever and ague, began
to give way, and led to a change in my everyday life.&nbsp; In
short I was ill, and admitted into hospital.&nbsp; As I ascended
the stairs that led from the worsted wards I had the consolation
of feeling I should not be forgotten.&nbsp; I had indeed left my
mark; I had crippled half the prison.</p>
<p>There are many abuses that might be changed with advantage,
and which I cannot do better than point out, in hopes that
somebody in authority will read, mark, and inwardly digest <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>them.&nbsp;
On each cell door is a card setting forth your name, sentence,
and full particulars.&nbsp; This placarding of one&rsquo;s name
is surely useless, as one is never called by it, and the only
object it appears to serve is to enable prisoners to discover all
about one another.&nbsp; My cell was once situated on the high
road to the chapel, and every malefactor <i>en route</i> to
worship made it his business to master my history.&nbsp; This
surely is unfair, and hardly contemplated by the
authorities.&nbsp; If it is absolutely essential that one&rsquo;s
name is to be placarded, why not inside instead of outside the
door, as was the custom before the Government took over the
prisons?</p>
<p>Too much at present is left to the turnkeys.&nbsp; They are,
indeed, the channel of communication and the only official with
whom the ordinary prisoner comes in contact.&nbsp; The chief
warder deputes details to the principal warders of divisions, who
in their turn confide them to the warders of wards, who again
leave the carrying out to the turnkeys of flights.&nbsp; It is
not fair that so much should be left to these
assistants&mdash;which, despite any assertion to the contrary, is
the case&mdash;and who, though counting in their ranks many
highly respectable men, have also some desperate
rascals&mdash;vindictive, <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>deceitful, and utterly unfit for any
discretionary powers, and who would stick at no degree of
brutality if capable of being indulged in with impunity.</p>
<p>The use of the same baths by prisoners and men previous to
medical examination cannot be too strongly deprecated.&nbsp; That
a clean man should be compelled to risk contagion with one
suffering from itch or covered with vermin is as filthy as it is
disgraceful.&nbsp; With all the space at their disposal the
wonder is a swimming bath has never commended itself.</p>
<p>Every warder in charge of a ward has a prisoner allotted to
him, who performs such necessary duties as cleaning his office
and assisting him in his multifarious returns.&nbsp; These men
are generally selected from the clerk or tradesman class, and
have great facilities for knowing everything that passes through
the office.&nbsp; I have found, indeed, that they know and hear a
great deal too much.</p>
<p>Thus a descriptive return containing every particular about
one from one&rsquo;s youth up, and supposed to be a confidential
document, is carefully studied by these cleaners, and facts
likely to be of general interest&mdash;especially about
&ldquo;celebrities&rdquo;&mdash;go <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the round of the prison.&nbsp; These
documents should either <i>not</i> be in the warders&rsquo;
charge, or if so, should be carefully locked up.&nbsp; In my
opinion they would be more appropriately assigned to the care of
the principal warders of divisions.&nbsp; These cleaners, if
dishonestly or greedily inclined, appropriate considerably more
than their share of the daily rations.&nbsp; In one ward I
seldom, or ever, got my supply of Monday bacon, which had either
been filched or bitten in half; and as the original supply does
not exceed the proportions of a postage stamp, it can ill afford
this wholesale reduction.</p>
<p>I cannot leave the subject of &ldquo;warders&rdquo; without
bearing my testimony to their excellency as a class&mdash;I
specially refer to those in charge of wards, and not to their
washerwomen and plumbers and glaziers
<i>confr&egrave;res</i>.&nbsp; The multiplicity of returns they
have to render daily, the alterations, however trivial, that are
constantly occurring and have to be noted, and the serious
consequences attending the slightest error or omission, all
combine to make their duties and responsibilities more arduous
than any class of men I have seen.&nbsp; Their pay for this,
moreover, is so small&mdash;29s. a week, with a gradual <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>rise&mdash;that many otherwise excellent men shrink
from accepting promotion.&nbsp; The colour-sergeants of the army
might learn a lesson from these warders, and if the
&ldquo;descriptive return&rdquo; in use, and which supplies every
information, was substituted for the ponderous ledgers, small
books, defaulter sheets, etc., as used in the army, it would come
like the Waverley pen&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>As a blessing and boon to sergeants and men.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE CONVALESCENT
WARD.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my admission into hospital I was
at first sent to the convalescent ward, a huge room devoted to
light and unpronounced cases.&nbsp; It accommodates 40 patients,
and the entire furniture may be roughly estimated as consisting
of 40 beds, 40 tables, 40 chairs, one shovel and tongs, and one
thermometer.&nbsp; The beds are ranged round the entire room, the
tables and chairs a yard apart forming two rows down the centre;
the thermometer is suspended from a beam, the shovel is chained
to one fire-place, and the tongs to the other.&nbsp; A high desk
and a still higher stool complete the furniture of this singular
room.&nbsp; The fixtures are of a more unique kind; at one end
are the cabinets, at the other the lavatories.&nbsp; These are
simply boarded partitions, extending only about three feet from
the ground&mdash;so constructed <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>as to make it absolutely impossible
to conceal more than one-third of the body, however engaged; thus
admirably adapted for observation, but utterly regardless of
privacy or decency, and revolting in their proximity to a room
devoted to convalescents.&nbsp; Along the walls here and there
are chains hanging.&nbsp; These are the alarm bells for
communicating with the outer yard in case of fire, mutiny, or
other emergency.&nbsp; At each corner are the padded
cells&mdash;grim, sombre constructions&mdash;admirably adapted
for deadening sound, and fitted with every appliance for the
restraint of violent and demented criminals.&nbsp; The proximity
of these cells is very awful, and the shrieks that occasionally
emanate from them, and the sights I have seen, would have filled
me with horror six months previously.&nbsp; The treatment of
convalescents is as original as can well be conceived.&nbsp; The
day is mapped out into the following portions, which are observed
with a punctuality seldom attained except by
chronometers:&mdash;</p>

<p>The dietary is the simple prison fare, although many (I
amongst others) are on what is known as ordinary
diet&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, cocoa, mutton broth, and a chop&mdash;and
others on low diet, consisting of tea, bread-and-butter,
beef-tea, rice pudding, etc.&nbsp; Discipline is little or
nothing relaxed here; indeed the general system is evidently
based on what is considered applicable to confirmed patients not
suffering from any acute disease, and lunatics real and
pretended.&nbsp; Shortly after rising a shout of
&ldquo;Physic!&rdquo; causes a rush to get the first pull at
one&rsquo;s respective medicines; and as the same mug does duty
for everything, and as time is an object, it has been found that
a dose of hop mixture is not improved if augmented by the dregs
of the black draught left by one&rsquo;s predecessor.&nbsp; Being
always up and washed whilst my brother-reprobates were still
dozing, I was invariably the first to benefit by a clean mug, and
devoted the next few minutes to watching the frowsy cluster of
depravity, half dressed, half awake, and just out of bed, drink
or throw away their doses as opportunity permitted.&nbsp; <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Although
strictly prohibited, many of these wretches usually turned in
with their stockings on, and in some instances with their
trowsers; and on rising, having previously assumed boots and
vest, proceeded to wash.&nbsp; I minutely watched this ceremony,
and seldom detected the slightest desire to do more than make
clean the extreme outer rim of their cups and platters,
extending&mdash;humanly speaking&mdash;from the hand to the
elbow, and from the chin to the ear.&nbsp; Although in many
respects preferable to the prison proper, this convalescent ward
was one of the severest ordeals I had to undergo.&nbsp; I would
not have missed it for the world, nevertheless, to sleep, live,
move, and have one&rsquo;s being amongst thirty or forty
pickpockets, idiots, burglars, and lunatics, implies an
experience that baffles description.&nbsp; At 6.30 the advent of
two wash-tubs, containing respectively cocoa and gruel, announces
breakfast, which, being carefully measured into tins, is consumed
in an incredibly short time, and devoured with the voracity never
to be seen except in menageries or prisons.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that the room contains specimens of some of the
sharpest pickpockets in London, and experts at every dodge <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>for the
deceiving of their fellows, compelled by circumstances to be
huddled together, and relieved from the isolation of separate
cells that makes them comparatively powerless for mischief.&nbsp;
It cannot be wondered at, then, that the rules require, if
anything, to be more stringent; but all the vigilance of the
sharpest warder is powerless, and no two eyes capable of seeing
or preventing the wholesale exchange of food that now
begins.&nbsp; If the warder is looking this way, a loaf will
change hands for a mug of gruel in the twinkling of an eye; if he
suddenly turns round, advantage is taken of it to swap something
on the other side; and at dinner hour especially, I have seen
bread, potatoes, and lumps of meat flying about with a rapidity,
precision of aim, and a profound silence, only disturbed by the
&ldquo;flop, flop,&rdquo; as they reached the various hands, that
would have done credit to the most expert Oriental-Whitechapel
juggler.&nbsp; After breakfast everyone is supposed to remain at
his table without interruption the entire day, except during
exercise, and time is only to be beguiled by reading such
wholesome literature as &ldquo;The Converted Burglar, and how he
did it,&rdquo; as the chaplain may be graciously pleased to
supply.&nbsp; At the side <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>of each table is considerately
placed a handful of fibre, which is purely optional whether
picked or no.&nbsp; I attribute its presence indeed to the
association that invariably exists in official minds between
hospitals, chapels, and mortuaries, and only capable of being
dealt with on the principle that a certain old gentleman
&ldquo;finds some mischief still for convalescent hands to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily no one really is ill in the convalescent ward (he
would then be removed to the hospital), or it would be absolutely
impossible to bear the incessant fuss from officials and filth
from the prisoners that never cease day or night.&nbsp; Not
twenty minutes elapse during the twenty-four hours that someone
is not passing through; and as every approach is barricaded and
double locked, the rattle of keys, the hobnailed boots of head
warders pounding over the floor, and the shouting and yelling,
and the necessity of &ldquo;sitting up&rdquo; to your table as
they pass through, make it almost unbearable for even a
convalescent.&nbsp; In addition to this is the absolute necessity
of keeping one&rsquo;s eye on one&rsquo;s next-tabled
neighbour.&nbsp; If you turn round during a meal, a piece of food
disappears, and any trifle you may happen to possess cannot <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>be
considered your own from one moment to another.&nbsp; I had a
worsted needle that I prized considerably; it fulfilled the
duties of a toothpick, and had been my constant companion and
comforter for weeks.&nbsp; It was, indeed, my most cherished
possession.&nbsp; I usually kept it inside my cap, and my cap
outside my head; here at least it was safe, but one day, in a fit
of absence, I crossed over the room.&nbsp; On my return I
discovered that my cap had been rifled and the needle gone.</p>
<p>An old man (though only one of many) added considerably to my
burthen.&nbsp; He took a great fancy to me&mdash;or my
food&mdash;and seldom lost a chance of persecuting me.&nbsp; He
was never without a pocket-handkerchief stuffed full of crusts,
chop bones, suet pudding, or any garbage he could find, firmly
clutched by day, and placed under his pillow at night.&nbsp; He
was by way of being a gentleman, and said, with some degree of
truth, that he was a general officer (he was at present
undergoing three months&rsquo; retirement for stealing a
sovereign from a sixpenny lodging-house keeper).&nbsp; He
approached one with the blandest smile, hoped you were not
seriously ill, and asked how your appetite was.&nbsp; This,
indeed, was the burthen of <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>his song:&mdash;If you told him it
was bad, he begged you to kindly reserve your fragments for him;
if you said it was good, he stole what he could.&nbsp; The result
was consequently the same; and so to get rid of him I promised to
help him when I could.&nbsp; This nasty old man slept two beds
from me, and often during the night, &ldquo;when everything was
still,&rdquo; I have watched him unpack his treasure, and,
selecting certain of the stalest pieces for immediate use,
carefully tie up and restore the bundle to beneath his pillow or
mattress.</p>
<p>This hoarding and stealing of food was by no means confined to
the &ldquo;General&rdquo;; it was, indeed, so much in vogue that
periodical raids were made on the beds, and even inside the
shirts men were wearing, which invariably resulted in the
exhumation of sundry delicacies.&nbsp; So strong was the ruling
passion that one wretch with half a lung, who was allowed extras
which he never consumed, rather than part with a crumb, would
hide chops and even rice pudding in his pocket-handkerchief and
towel, or secrete them in his bedding or about his person.</p>
<p>That food was a drug in the market may be reasonably assumed;
and if further proof was <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>wanting, the reckless waste that
took place after meals would amply provide it.&nbsp; The supplies
of soup, porridge, cocoa, and gruel were invariably in excess of
the regulation personal allowance.&nbsp; Discipline, however,
demanded that so much and no more should be given to each man;
and I have seen gallons of capital soup and cocoa thrown down the
sink daily that many a starving wretch outside would gratefully
have devoured.&nbsp; I do not blame the hospital warders for this
custom so much as the kitchen officials for either sending too
much or adding too much water, for experience had taught them
that it was equally dangerous to give more or less than the
regulation allowance, and that they would probably be reported by
one thief, if another thief got more than himself; and it was a
common occurrence for vagrants who had never heard of arrowroot
before coming to Coldbath to complain of the thinness of their
nightly allowance as &ldquo;unfit to be eaten.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
once suggested to the head hospital warder (but my proposal was
never carried out) that the staple food of discontented vagrant
invalids should be treacle and brimstone, and that if they
complained of their diet, the treacle should be omitted by way of
variety.</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>I
don&rsquo;t know what is the annual expense of food, fuel, and
gas in the various prisons, but I confidently assert that an
immense saving would result if the coal at present issued <i>ad
lib.</i> for the use of the warders was as carefully weighed as
the prisoners&rsquo; various allowances.&nbsp; These turnkeys,
whose supply of coal at home is probably limited to half a
hundred a week, cannot here do without fires banked up a foot
high night and day in the various corridors; and I have often
been awakened in various parts of the prison by the shovelling
and piling on of coals on even temperate nights.&nbsp; I should
like no better billet than to be appointed contractor for the
coal and potatoes used and wasted in Her Majesty&rsquo;s
prisons.</p>
<p>Another means of keeping down the present excessive expenses
connected with prisoners&rsquo; keep and warders&rsquo; coals
would be the adoption of the sensible course pursued in France,
whereby the clothes of murdered men and the instruments with
which the murders have been committed, if not claimed within
three months, are sold by public auction.&nbsp; This might be
supplemented by the sale of the articles found in cabs and
elsewhere, often comprising objects of considerable value, and at
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>present
taken to Scotland Yard and never claimed.&nbsp; It will possibly
be urged that all this would be opposed to English tastes and
ideas; and yet it is an incontrovertible fact that the principal
purchasers at these &ldquo;art&rdquo; sales in Paris are English
and Americans, that the price of articles which have belonged to
notorious criminals generally rules very high, and that the
ghastly relics for the most part find their way to England.</p>
<p>Exercise was a most ridiculous ceremony; the tables were
pushed back, and everyone proceeded round and round in two
rings.&nbsp; A scene I once saw at some theatre, representing the
&ldquo;casual ward&rdquo; of a workhouse, more nearly resembles
it than anything I can think of.</p>
<p>Amongst my numerous companions in this delectable sport was a
celebrated pickpocket; who was good enough on my invitation to
show me &ldquo;how it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;&nbsp; My request,
indeed, appeared to flatter his vanity so much that on more than
one occasion, when I was not thinking of his particular talent,
he has removed my pocket-handkerchief, and politely returned it
as if pretending to pick it up.&nbsp; I once saw him bring his
science to bear on a thoughtless warder, who, through ignorance
<a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>probably
of his special talent, had asked him to brush him down.&nbsp; A
wink from the thief drew my attention to his movements, and I
watched him with profound interest.&nbsp; For some seconds he
confined himself to the legitimate brushing, but as he worked
round and the arm of his victim was slightly raised, with the
unemployed hand he deliberately opened the warder&rsquo;s pouch,
took out a piece of tobacco, and then quietly re-buttoned it;
with another smudge of the brush and &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;ll
do, sir,&rdquo; he resumed his place.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have
betrayed him for the world; indeed, I gave him some bread for the
exhibition.</p>
<p>It was pretty generally known that I was very green, and that
I was anxious to see everything; indeed, I never lost an
opportunity of conversing with everyone capable of telling me an
adventure; so that one way and another I heard a lot, much of
which I shall hereafter narrate.</p>
<p>Another oddity with whom I was associated was a
kleptomaniac.&nbsp; Nothing was safe from him, and his eye was as
quick as his hand.&nbsp; He might be seen at all hours sneaking
about, thrusting his arm between mattresses and occasionally into
people&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp; He was undergoing two years&rsquo;
<a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>imprisonment for stealing <i>two ounces of
tobacco</i>.&nbsp; So impossible was it for him to keep his hands
from picking and stealing that it was frequently necessary to
lock him into a separate cell for weeks at a time, only to be
released after piteous appeals and promises not to offend again,
which were invariably broken on the first opportunity.&nbsp; He
was as nimble as a cat, and occasionally gave an acrobatic
performance on the sly.&nbsp; The poor wretch was admittedly an
imbecile, and it seems inexplicable how he ever incurred the
punishment he received, though he was probably happier at
Coldbath than he was ever likely to be elsewhere.&nbsp; One day
he could not be found, and after the hue-and-cry had been raised
and the prison and grounds scoured, he was found concealed in a
tank on a portion of the roof.&nbsp; What he could have wanted
there is beyond comprehension, for he dreaded the water and never
washed unless compelled.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal of prisoners escaping, and from
the penal establishments it is unquestionably practicable.&nbsp;
At a prison conducted, however, on the Coldbath Fields&rsquo;
principle such an idea is simply absurd.&nbsp; I do not refer to
the impediments of locks and doors so much as to the full blaze
of light system <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>along the corridors.&nbsp; The constant countings, too,
and patrols night and day would at once discover the truant, to
say nothing of the 20-feet wall that surrounds the
building.&nbsp; I have occasionally read descriptions of escapes
from the Bastille, where prisoners with a yard of rope, a spare
shirt, and an oyster knife, have burrowed and scaled and got
clean off.&nbsp; I am not in a position to dispute these
assertions, but I will willingly undertake to provide the most
expert acrobat with a sack full of ropes, crowbars, and linen,
<i>in</i> his cell, and stake my existence that he does not
proceed five feet beyond his premises without detection.&nbsp;
The escape of a notorious burglar from Millbank Convict Prison
last year gave rise at the time to considerable discussion
amongst the officials at Coldbath Fields.&nbsp; That a man should
be able to break through the roof of a cell during the early
hours of morning without creating a disturbance seems incredible,
and had the corridors had the same acoustic properties as those
at Coldbath, would have been simply impossible without
collusion.</p>

<p>So extraordinarily is sound conveyed in these vast and barren
tunnels that every word spoken during the night at the other end
of the passage is distinctly audible, <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>whereas conversation close by is
almost unintelligible, so great is the echo.&nbsp; I think Mr.
Burglar Lovell may congratulate himself that he had not been
relegated to Coldbath Fields, for he would most assuredly have
derived less benefit there from his sixty feet of rope than he
appears to have done at Millbank.&nbsp; A prisoner attempting to
escape forfeits all the time he may have completed of his
sentence&mdash;a sufficient deterrent for a sane man!&nbsp; A
very disgusting adjunct to the convalescent ward is &ldquo;Itch
Bay,&rdquo; and though comparatively distinct, is actually next
door, and leads from it.&nbsp; It is devoted to those filthy
creatures who, on admission, are found to abound in vermin, or
who, after months in prison&mdash;as can be verified&mdash;have
caught the disease (according to my theory) by using the
universal bath.&nbsp; The treatment of this complaint can hardly
be said to be a pleasant, although undoubtedly a very effectual
one.&nbsp; A man is taken to &ldquo;the bay,&rdquo; made to strip
off all his clothes, put into a separate cell, and smeared with a
thick coating of mercurial ointment, and left to soak for three
days at least, and often longer.&nbsp; His bedding may best be
described as an ointment mattress, with &ldquo;blankets to
match,&rdquo; so saturated is everything in this fearful <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>quarter,
the stench from which pervades the passage, and works into the
convalescent ward.&nbsp; I used almost daily to see these
loathsome objects, either before admission or after three
days&rsquo; retirement, and it is difficult to say which is the
most revolting.&nbsp; On admission, and previous to treatment, I
have seen three or four of these unclean things waiting to be
admitted.&nbsp; During this time&mdash;often an hour and
more&mdash;they sit in the convalescent ward, use the furniture,
and circulate with the others.&nbsp; This surely is wrong, and
may justly be laid to the charge of negligent warders!&nbsp; On
leaving they are again taken through the ward, devoid of all
covering but the saturated blanket, and conducted to a
bath.&nbsp; This bath is a fixture in the hospital kitchen.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, the <i>itch bath</i> in the
principal prison of civilized London <i>is in the hospital
kitchen</i>!&nbsp; I have seen these social pariahs splashing
about within a few feet of the kitchen fire, whilst a rice
pudding was being made&mdash;an appetizing accompaniment to the
preparation of human food.&nbsp; This gross outrage on
cleanliness must fairly be charged to the Home Office people; and
as the kitchen is situated in the main thoroughfare, and passed
through almost daily by visiting justices or prison
commissioners, it is <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>clearly no official&rsquo;s business
to point it out&mdash;and if a surgeon represented it he would
probably be told to mind his own business.&nbsp; This is in
conformity with prison usage, and anyone mentioning, or taking
apparent interest in a trifle not actually connected with his
special department, is at once suspected of some sinister
motive.&nbsp; I have heard officials regret this disgusting
institution, and their inability to remedy it.</p>
<p>I have more horrors connected with this kitchen to mention
when I describe the hospital, and hope some one whose business it
is will redress this crying shame.&nbsp; As a set-off to the many
discomforts attending the convalescent ward, were the facilities
it offered for the uninterrupted working of the telephone, and so
multifarious were the opportunities, and so utterly impossible
detection, that I omitted the commonest precautions as absolutely
superfluous.&nbsp; My favourite time for correspondence was
between two and four in the morning.&nbsp; I noticed that nature
usually asserted itself on turnkey humanity, and that the most
watchful became drowsy about this time.&nbsp; It must be
remembered that a night warder is in the room all night, and that
the gas, though turned down, is alight.&nbsp; <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>I
frequently wrote for two hours at a time, and as my bed was next
the fire-place I had the advantage of poking it into a blaze as
circumstances required.&nbsp; I often wondered whether these
watch-dogs were really dozing.&nbsp; That they had not the
faintest suspicion I am confident; the very possibility of such
coolness may possibly have disarmed them, for I have written for
hours under their very noses.&nbsp; One night I had a
considerable scare.&nbsp; I had been carried away by the interest
of my letter, and whether I had thought aloud and some word had
escaped me I cannot say, but on peeping round the mantelpiece I
saw one of the most ferocious of the tribe&mdash;who was on duty
that night&mdash;leaning forward and peering in my
direction.&nbsp; His eyes glistened like a cheetah&rsquo;s as he
cautiously approached the fire-place&mdash;the mantelpiece and
one bed alone separated our respective positions, the rattle of a
paper, or a hurried motion, would have been fatal; so, proceeding
to mutter in my sleep, I slid my arm over a very damning
pile.&nbsp; For some moments he stood intently watching me, and
then happily began to poke the fire.&nbsp; Had he delayed much
longer I should inevitably have betrayed myself; as it was, the
noise &ldquo;justified&rdquo; my being <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>disturbed,
and I rolled round, &ldquo;papers under,&rdquo; as
<i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> would once have described a pugilistic
round.&nbsp; The danger was now past, but I had quite determined,
if he had asked me any unpleasant questions, to have made a dash
at the fire-place and destroyed the evidence.&nbsp; There is a
curious invention that exists in various parts of the
prison.&nbsp; Detector-clocks are intended to show that a warder
must have been alert every half-hour, by being required to press
down a pin.&nbsp; This pin is so constructed that it cannot be
let down except at the exact time, or unless the clock is
unlocked.&nbsp; These various clocks undergo a minute inspection
the following morning, and if all the pins are not down the
delinquent is fined a shilling, or even more, for each
omission.&nbsp; I could tell some curious stories about these
detector clocks, but their narration might be interpreted as
pointing in directions I have no intention of indicating.&nbsp; I
may, however, without compromising anyone, state that if the
authorities conceive they are aware of the exact number of keys
that open these clocks, they are considerably out of their
reckoning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eye, old man,&rdquo; I one morning said to an
acquaintance, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve missed two or three
pins.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a pal outside that&rsquo;ll make it all right before
I&rsquo;m relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At 6.30, when my friend was, I hope, comfortably in bed, I saw
the Detector inspected and found &ldquo;correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion a friend kindly supplemented the rubbishy
literature provided by the chaplain by lending me to read the
book of &ldquo;Rules for the Guidance of Warders and
Assistant-Warders.&rdquo;&nbsp; They can hardly be said to be as
interesting as those lately published by Howard Vincent for the
guidance of the police, although, situated as I was, they were to
me vastly more important.&nbsp; I had intended to have produced
them verbatim, but they are not of sufficient general
interest.&nbsp; They, however, deal with the various duties of
warders in that absurd style which attempts to impress on them
the responsibility and general respectability of what, if carried
out in its integrity, is a contemptible system of espionage.</p>

248</span>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CRIMINAL LUNATICS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the padded cells was a
dangerous lunatic.&nbsp; For weeks and months he had kept up an
incessant conversation with himself, occasionally diversified by
shrieks and yells.&nbsp; At first it was believed the man was
shamming, and he was taken before the visiting justices and
sentenced to be flogged, but this usually infallible cure had not
the desired effect.&nbsp; Clothes were converted into rags in an
incredibly short space of time.&nbsp; He was handcuffed in front,
and still they were destroyed.&nbsp; He was handcuffed behind
with the same result.&nbsp; On his door being opened he would be
found naked, the handcuffs on the floor, and his clothes in
shreds.&nbsp; Canvas sacks, with slits for the head and hands,
were suggested, and, first clothed, then handcuffed with his
hands behind him, and finally covered with the huge sack, he was
again <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>consigned to the cell.&nbsp; The same result, however,
invariably followed, and the kind-hearted doctor, despairing of
cure, and though inwardly convinced it was an artfully contrived
sham, yet loth to persist in the stringent remedies that alone
were effectual, gave him the benefit of the doubt, and consigned
him to the Criminal Lunatic Asylum at Hanwell.&nbsp; I have
frequently seen this maniac fed.&nbsp; His door was opened and he
was brought out, and, half-naked and handcuffed, bleared, filthy,
and bleeding from self-inflicted injuries, with dishevelled hair,
and glaring like a panther, this wild beast in human form would
open his mouth, and gruel and bread be shovelled in
bounteously.&nbsp; Attempts would occasionally be made to induce
him to wash, but at best they were qualified successes, and the
assistance of four or five turnkeys had eventually to be resorted
to.&nbsp; It was impossible to believe this being was sane and
capable of keeping up the deception for such a time.&nbsp; Sleep
was out of the question, for night was made hideous by the
muffled shouts and blasphemies that forced themselves through the
padded cell.&nbsp; But a reprieve at length came, and it was with
a sense of relief that I one morning saw him taken <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>off to
Hanwell.&nbsp; The lull, however, was not of long duration; and
he was eventually sent back as &ldquo;cured.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
cure showed itself in a curious way.&nbsp; On finding himself
again in his old quarters, and smarting under a pretended sense
of breach of faith, he raved that the doctor at Hanwell had
promised to release him if he withdrew his claim to the crown of
Ireland.&nbsp; And now a reign of terror began in earnest, and
shouting for Parnell, his secretary, the Empress Eugenie, and Old
Ireland, he raved and roared day and night.&nbsp; How human
nature could bear such a strain appeared marvellous.&nbsp; One
night all was calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; I
thought, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s collapsed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he?&nbsp;
The wish, alas! was father to the thought, and the lull was only
the precursor of the storm.&nbsp; Whilst we were sleeping the
maniac was maturing his plans, and a shout of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
one night reminded us of his proximity.&nbsp; Smoke was now
issuing from the padded cell.&nbsp; To draw back the ponderous
bolts was the work of a second.&nbsp; To distinguish anything was
absolutely impossible.&nbsp; Blinding smoke filled the cell, and
as it poured out a terrible sight presented itself.&nbsp; On the
floor was the charred mattress, the horse-hair alight, and the <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>plank bed
smouldering, and peacefully lying beside it was the madman.&nbsp;
The first idea was that he was dead, but the smoke that would
have killed a sane man had but temporarily stupefied him.&nbsp;
In an instant he was on his feet, and, his arms being free, made
a desperate attack with pieces of glass on the two men who had
humanely approached him.&nbsp; Further help was now sent for,
during which time he kicked, struck, and bit everything within
reach, and it required sixteen men to secure and remove this wild
beast in human form.&nbsp; The extent of his mischief now made
itself apparent.&nbsp; How he had removed the handcuffs remains a
mystery, but with the cunning and dexterity only to be found in
maniacs, he had succeeded in reaching the gas, which, situated
ten feet from the ground, and protected by a strong glass, must
have taxed his ingenuity, not only to reach, but eventually to
open, and yet this had been done so quietly that forty men and a
watchful warder in the adjoining room heard nothing.&nbsp; With
the fire now at his disposal, he had burnt the straps that were
lashed round his body to secure the sack, but finding the effect
not sufficiently expeditious, had proceeded to pull out the <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>bed-stuffing, and lying down naked, bruised, and
bleeding, beside the smouldering mass, calmly awaited the
conflagration that was to free him.&nbsp; The cell presented an
extraordinary appearance.&nbsp; On the floor were broken glass,
burning wood, and his clothes torn to shreds; here the handcuffs,
there the charred straps: the walls were smeared with filth and
dabbed with porridge; the plank bed was torn up, and plaster and
brickwork removed: a terrible wreck, an incredible performance,
and all the work of two hands, handcuffed behind and strapped,
and surrounded by every precaution that official ingenuity could
suggest.</p>
<p>This final escapade materially assisted the magisterial
finding as to the extent of the maniac&rsquo;s
&ldquo;cure,&rdquo; and he was again consigned to Hanwell.</p>
<p>Another lunatic of a different type was an inmate of the
convalescent ward, a harmless, inoffensive creature, that had
been flogged out of his senses.&nbsp; His physique proclaimed him
incapable of doing bodily harm to a calf.&nbsp; He was not more
than five feet high, with a fore-arm like a robin&rsquo;s thigh,
and the receding forehead, sunken eye, and conical skull
associated with imbecility; <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>but he had once
&ldquo;threatened&rdquo; a warder, a hulking, round-shouldered
old woman, that might have squeezed the life out of him without
turning a hair, and discipline demanded he should be reported,
and the visiting justices sentenced him to be flogged.&nbsp; From
that day he never spoke, and would sit for hours without moving;
suddenly he would break out into an immoderate fit of laughter,
to be immediately followed by a paroxysm of grief, and, laying
his head on the table, would sob like a child.&nbsp; Nothing
appeared likely to restore his naturally limited intellect, and
the country will be at the expense of keeping this
&ldquo;dangerous criminal&rdquo; for another twelvemonth, who
would be infinitely more at home at Earlswood Asylum for
Idiots.&nbsp; A perfect child occupied another of these hospital
cells, an incorrigible young scamp of about fourteen, that
nothing seemed capable of taming.&nbsp; Everything within reach
he proceeded to destroy, and clothes supplied him in the morning
were in shreds at night.&nbsp; He, too, was constantly
handcuffed; he refused to eat, and for a week nothing passed his
lips.&nbsp; One day, on his door being opened, he was found
suspended by a bed-strap from the bell-handle: <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>another
second, and life would have been extinct.&nbsp; For this he was
taken before the visiting justices and birched.&nbsp; It had,
however, no deterrent effect, and up to the time of his release
he remained the same incorrigible young ruffian.&nbsp; There is
no hope for such a lad; his future is bound to be a repetition of
many instances I saw amongst the adults, who had commenced a
career of crime with birchings, followed by three and five years
in a reformatory, and ending with imprisonment and eventually
penal servitude.&nbsp; Another companion that was the source of
occasional anxiety, had been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, and
though usually quiet, was subject to extraordinary fits.&nbsp;
The first intimation of one coming on was a demoniacal groan, and
in an incredibly short time a space was cleared round him.&nbsp;
It had been found, indeed, that nothing could arrest the first
paroxysm, and on the &ldquo;band beginning to play,&rdquo; a
stampede invariably ensued: and not without cause, for everything
within reach became an instant wreck, and tables, chairs, books,
and (when procurable) arms and noses, were ruthlessly attacked by
hands, feet, and teeth.&nbsp; When comparatively restored it took
six or eight men to <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>remove him into a cell, and the only
thing that appeared to rouse him was the presence of the
priest.&nbsp; So efficacious was this remedy that when everything
else failed, the Roman Catholic chaplain was invariably sent for,
and in a moment oil appeared to be thrown on the troubled waters,
and the maniac arose subdued, and clothed in his right
mind.&nbsp; Here was a religion that appeared to appeal to the
feelings, and to produce results never attained by brow-beating
and personality&mdash;a lesson to be laid to heart, and worthy of
imitation, though in the quarter it was most needed it was, I
fear, utterly thrown away.&nbsp; Personally this influence did
not surprise me, for though debarred, by being a Protestant, from
coming into actual contact with the priest, I was considerably
struck, and almost fascinated, by the kind smile and friendly
salutation he had for all his co-religionists.&nbsp; An Italian
by nationality, with all the refinement of manner habitual to his
countrymen, this polished gentleman was a pronounced contrast to
the fire-and-brimstone snob occasionally met with in the
&ldquo;Established&rdquo; ranks.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PRISON CELEBRITIES.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> surprised at the number of
respectable men&mdash;such as solicitors, an ex-officer of
Guards, a bank manager, a man of title, stockbrokers, cashiers,
ex-officers of the army and navy, clerks, clergymen,
etc.&mdash;in Coldbath Fields.&nbsp; Some of these had quite lost
(supposing they ever had any) their pristine semblance of
respectability; others, again, retained the appearance of persons
of education, and spoke and deported themselves as such.&nbsp; A
lamentable instance of the fatal effect of associating with the
scum, and the ease with which a young man of good position can
acquire the style and appearance of a vagrant, was exemplified in
young B&mdash;.&nbsp; He was not more than 25 or 26, had been a
subaltern in the &mdash; Guards, and came, moreover, of a good
county stock; and yet in six short months he had so far
degenerated as <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>to be punished on the day his sentence expired for
stealing a loaf from a fellow prisoner.</p>
<p>A worthy old man with grey hair and venerable appearance, and
who might have passed for the chairman of a board of directors,
appeared every morning at mine and other cells in the passage
with a dust-pan, and with methodical precision removed the
sweepings.&nbsp; He told me he had been a solicitor with a large
connection, with chambers in &mdash; Street, and had a wife and
grown-up family in a comfortable house in a well-known
suburb.&nbsp; His imprisonment was perceptibly telling on him,
and his hair and beard grew whiter every day.</p>
<p>A bustling, business-like man, one day attracted my
attention.&nbsp; He was connected with the stores, and brought me
a new pair of boots.&nbsp; He had been the manager of a London
bank, and undergoing retirement for six months for some error
regarding the ownership of &pound;300.</p>
<p>A tall, smart-looking man that was pointed out to me, was, I
was informed, an individual who attained notoriety some two years
ago over a mining scheme.&nbsp; He was suffering two years&rsquo;
incarceration for a miscalculation of over &pound;7000.</p>
<p>A man who called himself Count H&mdash;, and an <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>ex-convict
to boot, was languishing for a year, because certain noblemen had
had the bad taste to object to his having obtained money from
them by false pretences.&nbsp; This nobleman! had a mania for
petitioning the Home Office (I will give a specimen of his style
hereafter).</p>
<p>In addition to these, numerous individuals who had been
gentlemen in their day were known to me by sight.&nbsp;
Conspicuous amongst them, was an old jail bird and ex-convict,
who had 20 years ago been a captain in the army, and ever since
had existed (and still is) in prison, for terms of seven, five,
five, two, and one years.&nbsp; All the starch had been
thoroughly wrung out of him, though he occasionally stood on a
dilapidated kind of dignity.&nbsp; I once asked him where a
friend of his had gone.&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know; we don&rsquo;t speak now; he&rsquo;s no gentleman.&nbsp;
Will you believe it, he had the impertinence to doubt my
word.&rdquo;&nbsp; As his word had been doubted a good many times
during the past 20 years, I was considerably amused by this
assumption of dignity.</p>
<p>Many prisoners are under the impression that they have only to
petition the Home Office to procure a remission of their
sentence.&nbsp; It seems <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>perfectly immaterial to them,
whether they have the slightest grounds for this assumption or
not, and it frequently happens that, instead of mitigating their
offence, they put matters in a more unfavourable light by airing
their grievances, whilst others make a rambling statement
referring to every subject but the one particularly concerning
themselves.</p>
<p>Count H&mdash; was a specimen of this class.&nbsp; He was
undergoing a well-merited 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment for
defrauding the Dukes of S&mdash; and M&mdash; and other noblemen
of sums of money, by representing himself as the son of some
individual, which he certainly was not.&nbsp; It is, of course,
possible that he may (to use a vulgar expression) have been
&ldquo;changed at nuss,&rdquo; though the fact that he had
previously undergone five years&rsquo; penal servitude for a
similar offence minimizes the probability that he was acting
under a misapprehension.&nbsp; The Count! had no sooner taken up
his quarters than he expressed a desire to petition the Home
Secretary.&nbsp; A &ldquo;form&rdquo; being supplied him, which
he retained four days, eventually reappeared so blurred and
smeared with blots and erasures that its transmission was
impossible.&nbsp; <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>A second attempt was more successful, and the following
exhaustive specimen of penmanship and veracity struggled up to
the Home Office, and eventually struggled back:&mdash;&ldquo;That
your petitioner, on being discharged from Pentonville Convict
Prison, at the expiration of five years&rsquo; penal servitude,
found that certain moneys and property, valued at several hundred
pounds, had been stolen by his agent, who collected his rent on
his estates in Italy; that being at that time without funds to go
abroad, he had written to the Duke of S&mdash; and Duke of
M&mdash; and others, asking for a loan until he received his
rents.&nbsp; That his father really was Count H&mdash; and a
friend of these noblemen, and that the charge of false pretences
was consequently incorrect.&nbsp; That he had held diplomatic
appointments, and been decorated for gallant service, and that he
possesses a coronet with S.P.Q.R., all of which clearly proves
his identity.&nbsp; In conclusion, your petitioner appeals to you
with confidence as a lawyer of renown, and a scion of the noble
house of Vernon.&mdash;Signed, H&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have corrected &ldquo;the Count&rsquo;s&rdquo; spelling as
far as possible; the logic and composition were, however, past
redemption.&nbsp; The rogue evidently knew the <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Home
Secretary&rsquo;s claim to &ldquo;Royal descent,&rdquo; as
delicately hinted at in the concluding paragraph.</p>
<p>Another individual petitioned against his hair and beard being
cut, on religious grounds, and quoted the Law of Moses as
forbidding these formalities.&nbsp; This specimen did not, I
believe, leave the establishment.</p>
<p>I was frequently struck by the vast difference in the
sentences awarded in what appeared to me to be parallel cases,
and tried in vain to discover any system that might be supposed
to regulate them.&nbsp; It cannot be denied that a great
difference of opinion exists apparently amongst judges on the
subject of crimes and their punishment, and that whereas one
judge will administer justice with harshness, another will attain
the same desirable end with a regard to humanity.&nbsp; With
these respective characteristics, the criminal classes are
thoroughly conversant, and it would astonish the Bench if they
heard how accurately their respective peculiarities are summed
up.&nbsp; Thus one judge is credited with being very severe on
conspiracy and long firm cases, whilst another is supposed to be
&ldquo;down&rdquo; on burglars, whilst it is generally conceded
that a plea of guilty will invariably fare <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>better than
one of not guilty.&nbsp; For my own part I fancied I had noticed
that conspiracy is considered the most serious offence, and that
two men conspiring to defraud another of &pound;50 will run the
risk of a severer punishment than the individual who unaided
steals &pound;500.</p>
<p>I will quote a few first offences which, apparently similar,
differ considerably as regards their sentences:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) A solicitor for passing a forged cheque for
&pound;18 that had been paid to him: 18 months&rsquo;
imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) A bank manager for appropriating &pound;300: six
months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) A wine merchant for complicity in a forged cheque,
&pound;52: sentence, 18 months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard
labour.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) A commission agent for forging a &pound;600 bill of
exchange: 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) A clerk (with twenty years&rsquo; good character
and recommended to mercy), for forging &pound;50 and stealing
employer&rsquo;s cheque: <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>sentence, twenty months&rsquo;
imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) A City man, for a fraudulent mining scheme and
forgery, whereby he obtained &pound;7000: sentence, two
years&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) A shopman, for robbing his employer of &pound;50:
sentence, three months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) A beggar boy, for stealing 1s. 6d.: sentence, three
months&rsquo; imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>There are men in Coldbath whose cards show upwards of seventy
previous convictions, varying from a year to seven days; nor is
it to be wondered at, considering the starvation that confronts
them outside and the comfort that is accorded them in
prison.&nbsp; One of these habitual vagrants on his periodical
appearance was usually accosted with an official joke,
&ldquo;Same address, I suppose?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
please,&rdquo; was the invariable reply; &ldquo;no change since
last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One old man in the convalescent ward, suffering from
rheumatism and asthma, who was supplied with dainties he could
never have heard of before, <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>confessed to me that he should have
preferred six to the three months&rsquo; imprisonment he was
undergoing.&nbsp; Another old vagrant (a City man) told me that
he always made it a rule to sleep on a doorstep a day or so
before Christmas Day to insure the Christmas meal of a loaf of
bread, beef, pudding, and a pint of ale, stood by the Lord Mayor
to every prisoner in Newgate.&nbsp; He was bewailing the loss of
that charming residence, and telling me how, having foolishly
omitted to make himself acquainted with the change of system, had
subsisted last Christmas Day in &ldquo;Coldbath&rdquo; on dry
bread and stirabout.</p>
<p>Foreigners of every description find their way into Coldbath,
though the majority consists of Germans, mostly Jews.&nbsp; There
is an advantage in belonging to this faith, as I was led to
understand by a gourmand.&nbsp; It consists in receiving meat on
Mondays in lieu of the usual bacon and beans.&nbsp;
Circumstances, however, render the temporary embracing of this
faith more difficult than they do that of Romanism, which is much
in vogue; and as certain punishment would follow the certain
detection, Judaism has not as many followers as the Australian
meat would otherwise command.</p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>Flogging is usually administered for insubordination
and malingering.&nbsp; For less serious offences the punishment
cells and short commons usually have the desired effect.&nbsp;
There are two descriptions of corporal punishment&mdash;the cat
and the birch, usually reserved for youths.&nbsp; In the former
case the culprit is lashed to a triangle; in the latter he is
hoisted on what is euphoniously called a donkey.&nbsp; As a
punishment, the cat, as applied in prisons, is not to be compared
to its defunct namesake in the army or navy.&nbsp; It is
sufficiently severe, however, to necessitate certain
after-treatment&mdash;an item in the programme regulated rather
by the &ldquo;system&rdquo; than humanity.&nbsp; A soldier was
invariably admitted into hospital after undergoing corporal
punishment; a prisoner is, however, flogged and then conducted to
his cell.</p>
<p>These floggings are usually administered in the forenoon in
presence of a surgeon, and before evening a zinc
plaster&mdash;perhaps two&mdash;is applied to the
recipient&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The performance takes place in a
room off the main passage, and is not unattended with a certain
amount of ceremony.&nbsp; The traffic is stopped, and no
particulars transpire but the howls of the victim, which can be
heard all <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>over the building.&nbsp; Since the abolition of
Newgate, Coldbath has risen in retributive importance, and
garrotters sentenced to the lash here receive their
punishment.</p>
<p>A one-legged garrotter was lately flogged; his leg, which had
been amputated at the thigh, prevented his being securely tied,
and his abortive struggles procured him a flogging infinitely
severer than ordinarily experienced.&nbsp; Every blow fell on a
different place, and the twenty lashes left twenty wheals,
breaking the skin in a dozen different places.&nbsp; Sympathy
with a garrotter would be out of place, and no one can doubt that
he richly deserved his punishment; yet one&rsquo;s bowels of
compassion are instinctively moved by the description given to me
by an eye-witness, of a lump of bleeding humanity alone and
sobbing in a cell, and receiving at five in the afternoon a zinc
plaster to apply to the back that had been torn and lacerated in
the morning.</p>
<p>This treatment in no way reflects on the prison officials, who
simply carry out the regulations; it is the system that is to
blame, and is capable, like the dispensation of justice before
described, of considerable improvement on the score of
humanity.</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Floggings and birchings appear to have no effect on
these hardened criminals, and though they shriek and bellow
during the infliction, they invariably revert to the same
offence, and qualify for a second edition.&nbsp; Shamming madness
is a favourite form of malingering indulged in by
prisoners.&nbsp; The uneducated mind, however, invariably resorts
to the same tactics&mdash;a combination between the symptoms of
idiocy and hydrophobia that generally fails in its objects, and
invariably yields to treatment by the cat.</p>
<p>The boys that find their way into Coldbath are the most
hardened young scamps I ever saw.&nbsp; They are supposed to be
isolated, as required by recent agitation on the subject of
juvenile offenders.&nbsp; That the isolation is a farce need
hardly be said.&nbsp; At chapel they certainly occupy benches to
themselves, but so do the various wards and trades; the tasks
they are put to are similar to those done by adults; and the
pains and penalties they undergo are identical in time and
circumstance to those of the full-blown criminal.&nbsp; I have
seen these urchins on arrival, with their knuckles in their eyes,
blubbering in chapel, and a week later winking and making signs
as if determined to assert their <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>qualification to be clothed and
treated like their adult fellow-prisoners.</p>
<p>Tearing up their clothes is the favourite pastime of these
promising youths.&nbsp; I have frequently seen these children
marched along a passage, handcuffed behind, and preceded by a
warder carrying a bundle of rags three inches square, that
formerly represented their linen and clothes.&nbsp; The treatment
they receive puts this crime at a premium.&nbsp; Boys are
admittedly vain, and desirous of appearing as men to their older
associates, what more natural then, that a child (one of the
instances I refer to could not have been fourteen) should aspire
to the honour of appearing as a hero; marching through a crowded
passage with his manly work conspicuously displayed, treated,
moreover, like a real man, manacled, and eventually birched, and
receiving the approbation invariably accorded by the criminal
classes to the perpetrators of wanton mischief.&nbsp; One would
suppose that in a huge building like Coldbath Fields these
urchins might be absolutely isolated, and if their offences were
punished without the publicity that at present attends them, they
would soon be given up as not worth the consequence.&nbsp; <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>That the
treatment of this hardened class of boys is a difficult problem,
cannot be denied, and the cunning and ingenuity they display is
almost incredible.&nbsp; Fully aware that the visiting Justices
only visit the prison once a fortnight, and that without their
order a birching is impossible, it frequently happens that on the
day of their discharge every article of their clothing is made
into mincemeat.&nbsp; For this mischief they are absolutely free
from any consequence, it being an offence against the prison, and
not against the law.&nbsp; If a remedy was applied to this crime,
similar to the Article of War that provides against the
destruction of Government property, the delinquent might be
handed over to a policeman, and this would effectually stop the
practice.</p>

270</span>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TREAD-WHEEL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> Act of Parliament, all
prisoners, till quite recently, were photographed after admission
to the various prisons.&nbsp; This universal system is now
abolished, and since January, 1882, it is only reserved for
habitual criminals and prisoners sentenced to police
supervision.&nbsp; I had the good fortune to add to my
experiences and my desire to see everything, by coming under the
universal system, I having become a Government ward exactly
eleven days before the expiration of the Act.&nbsp; One morning,
whilst at exercise, my name was called amongst some half-a-dozen
others.&nbsp; I could not conceive what new atrocity I had
perpetrated, and what could have occurred to disturb the even
tenor of my ways.&nbsp; A few of my more experienced comrades,
however, enlightened me by remarking I was &ldquo;a-goin&rsquo;
to be tuk,&rdquo; and I found myself on <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>the road to
the studio.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p271b.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;Negatives kept.&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;Negatives kept.&rdquo;"
src="images/p271s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Photography such as this can hardly be considered artistic,
though I have seen worse, but not much.&nbsp; It probably,
however, answers all the requirements it is intended for.&nbsp;
These works of art are only produced in duplicate, and though I
offered a fabulous price to the seedy artist for an extra copy,
no business was done; for though negatives are kept, they are
kept under lock and key.&nbsp; Of the copies usually printed one
was presented to the Governor of Newgate (this individual being
lately abolished, I do not know who is now the recipient), the
other finds its way into the Coldbath album, and no doubt affords
pleasure and instruction at such jubilant gatherings as prison
lawn tennis parties, or warders&rsquo; beanfeasts, which I was
informed (though never invited) are occasionally indulged
in.&nbsp; Prisoners are taken in their own clothes, and it is a
matter of regret that the ones I then wore have gone the way of
all old clothes, for, like their owner, they did not improve by
their incarceration, and their huge proportions made them
worthless without alteration.&nbsp; Pose or position is a
secondary consideration, a good out-and-out resemblance is the
thing to be attained; a deformed <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>ear, or a fly-blown nose, would at
once be seized upon, and the lens directed point blank at such
fortunate distinctions.&nbsp; In my case there was nothing to
merit special reproduction, so with a smirk that would have
hanged me fifty years ago (for even here the &ldquo;artist&rdquo;
could not resist the conventional request) I qualified for the
Government album.&nbsp; On one side one&rsquo;s number is pinned
to one&rsquo;s coat, on the other is a slate with one&rsquo;s
name in full, thus supplying an index simple but complete, and in
proportion to the intellects of such probable students as the
motley crew one periodically saw at Newgate.&nbsp; To me the
ordeal had neither terror nor charms, though to some of my
companions it was evidently not agreeable.&nbsp; One rogue caused
considerable trouble by persistently protruding his chin or
distorting some feature; these antics were not indulged in in a
spirit of levity, but resorted to gradually as the cap was being
taken off.&nbsp; He evidently objected to an accurate likeness,
and so he might.&nbsp; I never could find out particulars, but
not long after he disappeared from Coldbath, and whether hanged
or a &ldquo;lifer,&rdquo; I never heard.&nbsp; <i>That</i>
photograph had fulfilled its mission.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>Visits to Coldbath cannot under ordinary circumstances
be undertaken by any but the most robust.&nbsp; The accommodation
is clearly intended for the scum of London, and it is unfair to
expect any respectable person to come unless smell-proof and
provided with a box of Keating&rsquo;s insect powder.&nbsp; I
received one visit under these revolting conditions, though my
subsequent ones left nothing to be desired.&nbsp; Conceive, then,
a cell eighteen feet by twelve, fitted with four partitions on
either side, divided by a narrow passage, with a warder walking
up and down.&nbsp; Into one of these cages the visitor is
conducted and locked in.&nbsp; Immediately opposite, and
similarly enclosed, is the object of his visit.&nbsp; In
appearance they resemble a Cochin China hen-coop; in size they
about equal the den of the untameable hy&aelig;na in a travelling
menagerie.&nbsp; Conversation of a private nature is out of the
question, as, indeed, is intended; topical subjects are tabooed,
and but for the sake of adding to my experiences I should never
have subjected myself or my friend to such nasty
conditions.&nbsp; Within a foot of one, and flanked on both
sides, was either a costermonger talking to his missus and her
frowsy, <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>unvaccinated-looking offspring, or a pickpocket hearing
the latest news from the Seven Dials; the Babel consequent being
such as to leave no alternative but to say nothing, or shout at
the top of one&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; There is a snobbishness about
this custom that went far to determine me in my course of
telephoning as the only way to retaliate effectually on official
inconsideration.&nbsp; No one would be foolish enough to expect
that a gentleman should be better treated than a costermonger
under such painful circumstances, although it would be an act of
consideration, involving neither inconvenience nor relaxation of
discipline, if some little discretion were exercised, as at
Newgate, regarding the visitors.</p>
<p>The tread-wheel occupies a prominent position in prison
life.&nbsp; There was none at Coldbath on my arrival, the old one
having been burnt down a short time previously.&nbsp; There is a
delightful interpretation to the three magic letters, C. B. F.
(Cold Bath Fields), that long puzzled me, and which takes its
origin&mdash;as I heard&mdash;from the ancient structure.&nbsp; I
had frequently heard this cheerful place referred to as
&ldquo;The Farm,&rdquo; and on enquiry <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>it was
explained that it was facetiously known as &ldquo;Charley
Bates&rsquo;s Farm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; it
appears, was a peculiarly ferocious turnkey that some years ago
superintended the tread-wheel, but whether burnt, like his toy,
or still burning, or alive, I have not the remotest idea.&nbsp;
Its successor was now being rapidly built, and all the artisan
talent procurable was laid on, in order to complete without delay
this necessary adjunct to hard labour.</p>
<p>A reference to the &ldquo;system of progressive stages&rdquo;
will obviate my repeating many details as to the particular men
put to this punishment, etc.</p>
<p>I had never seen a tread-wheel except from the stalls of the
Adelphi Theatre, and was particularly anxious to gratify my
curiosity.&nbsp; I cudgelled my brains as to how it was to be
managed, with such success that I eventually found myself on the
&ldquo;works.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I have the misfortune to be neither
a mechanic nor an artisan, and incapable of driving in a nail
without hammering my finger, and being a perfect infant in the
use of a shovel, I was at a loss to conceive how I could possibly
be employed; <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>but this difficulty was at length surmounted, and armed
with a brush I was put on a roving job.&nbsp; I had the run of
the building, with a kind of general instruction to brush
everything and everybody, up stairs and down stairs, and in the
warder&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; The warder in charge of this
building in course of construction, was a worthy man, incapable
of being tampered with, though I never tried him (why should I?),
but withal courteous, respectful, and considerate&mdash;one of
those men whose bringing up had thrown him amongst gentlemen, and
who knew how to maintain his own position without offending the
susceptibilities of others.&nbsp; The artisans under him worked
with a will, and reports and rows were things unknown, except on
scrubbing days, when some ill-conditioned hound happened to be
temporarily employed.&nbsp; My duties consisted in sitting about
in sheltered nooks with the broom between my knees, and on the
approach of a spy, with which the place was infested, to rise and
make furious lunges at imaginary spiders.&nbsp; These sweeps into
space were very effective, and, fatal as they would have been to
any insect had I seen one, were equally gratifying to their human
prototypes, whose <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>desire was to see one working hard.&nbsp; During my
employment in this building it was, I verily believe, the object
of more inspection than it had ever been before.&nbsp; I had been
informed by telephone that my antipathy had given a hint that I
was to be looked after, and if he was satisfied with the result I
certainly was.&nbsp; Not twenty minutes elapsed between the
various inspections, and occasionally they swarmed like
horse-flies in summer round a lump of sugar.&nbsp; These frequent
visits involved an immense loss of energy, and the casualties
amongst the spiders must have been enormous.&nbsp; When all had
been destroyed I constructed a pile of dirt&mdash;one pound of
dust to four of shavings&mdash;which I placed in a conspicuous
position.&nbsp; This was violently propelled from me during a
visit, and gently restored when the intruder had passed.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity of inspecting this huge instrument of
torture, and was considerably disappointed that I could not try
its effect.&nbsp; I had the gratification, however, of putting
some paint on one panel and a piece of putty into a hole, thereby
having assisted at the making of the wheel.&nbsp; Putting <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>putty into
a hole is not so easy as it may sound.&nbsp; At the inspection of
work next day I had the mortification of seeing my lump
condemned, and cruelly removed.&nbsp; The tread-wheel is moved by
elaborate machinery worked by powerful engines, which, in
addition to setting the wheel in motion, grinds corn in an
adjoining building for the use of the prison.&nbsp; It is
entirely different from the Adelphi one, and may be described as
four long cylindrical wheels extending the length of the building
on either side and along the gallery.&nbsp; Partitions, of
sufficient dimensions to enable a man to stand up, run the entire
length of the various wheels, thereby precluding all
communication between the several occupants.&nbsp; Two hundred
and sixty men can be &ldquo;on&rdquo; at once, and the punishment
is carried out on the principle of ten minutes &ldquo;off&rdquo;
and twenty minutes &ldquo;on.&rdquo;&nbsp; The victims are
marched down at 7.30 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, and
beguile the time thus pleasantly till 11.30.&nbsp; They return at
1.30 p.m., and continue the enjoyment till 5.</p>
<p>I am told this is considered an easy wheel, and men who have
experienced the working of others assured me that this one was
mere <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>child&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; A great deal depends on the
worker, and the experienced jail-bird rises&mdash;or, as it was
termed to me, &ldquo;waits for&rdquo;&mdash;the step with little
or no exertion.&nbsp; With the novice, however, it is severe
labour, and the exertion involved bathes him in
perspiration.&nbsp; A supply of warm water is given them on
returning to their cells of an evening, to obliterate in a degree
the unpleasant consequences of the wheel.&nbsp; But the
discomfort&mdash;can one estimate it?&nbsp; A poor wretch bathed
in perspiration, and having to sleep in the same shirt and work
in it for a week!&nbsp; Only prisoners fit for hard labour are
put to the wheel, and no man is ever so employed unless passed by
the surgeon.&nbsp; The doctor&rsquo;s work is considerably
augmented by the reconstruction of the wheel, and besides having
to visit the yard frequently during the day, he is persecuted by
strings of schemers trying by every conceivable subterfuge to
evade the punishment.&nbsp; Some go the length of tumbling off,
and occasionally succeed in temporarily disqualifying themselves
by a sprained ankle or wrist.&nbsp; I was much amused during my
employment at its construction at the interest that the various
officials took in every <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>detail connected with its
progress.&nbsp; They revelled at the prospect of the treat in
store for them, and seemed to gloat over the exquisite misery
awaiting some of their lambs.&nbsp; Bunches of these warders
would occasionally meet, and discuss the intricacies of the
machinery with a gusto only to be acquired by prison
contagion.&nbsp; It would not have surprised me to have heard
that the opening ceremony had been attended by some kind of
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, to which the warders and &ldquo;their
ladies&rdquo; had been invited, and condiments&mdash;made on the
premises&mdash;distributed wholesale.</p>
<p>My worst enemies, and those I had to fear most, were the
prisoners.&nbsp; They were all jealous of me, and had got an
absurd notion into their heads that I could do as I liked, and,
though there was no truth in such an impression, never lost an
opportunity of &ldquo;rounding&rdquo; on me.&nbsp; A one-eyed
scoundrel, who was one day checked and eventually punished for
idleness, complained to the Governor that he didn&rsquo;t see why
he should work all day and another man (me) sit down and do
nothing.&nbsp; This had the effect of causing me to be
transferred elsewhere, and I next added to my experiences by
becoming <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

wheelhouse, for it had a depressing effect on me, which the hum
of the traffic just outside did not assist in allaying.&nbsp; As
a wag said to me one day, &ldquo;This will be a nice place when
it&rsquo;s finished.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GARDENING.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> at last indeed tumbled on my
legs.&nbsp; My new duties offered a combination of
advantages&mdash;such as variety, fresh air, newspapers, tobacco,
etc.&mdash;far in excess of my fondest dreams.&nbsp; There are
six so-called gardeners, who are constantly employed in the
grounds.&nbsp; At 7.30 they go out, and rarely return before
dinner; and again at 2, remaining out till 5.&nbsp; In fine
weather this is a great relief, and I enjoyed many an afternoon
basking in the sun on a grassy bank.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The general duties of a so-called gardener are a combination
of the qualifications necessary for a dustman, carpet-beater, and
agricultural labourer.&nbsp; They are, in fact, the scavengers of
the establishment, and poke about all day under a curiosity of
the turnkey species, and overhaul everything and <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>everybody.&nbsp; Their duties are absolutely legion,
and carpet-beating, mowing, weeding, and raking the walks are
only a moiety of their accomplishments.&nbsp; I was appointed to
this favoured team through the kindly recommendation of the
assistant surgeon after my recent temporary discharge from
hospital; and the master gardener, not having been consulted, as
I fancy he usually was, was not by any means predisposed in my
favour.&nbsp; That, however, wore off; and though I found him the
most crotchety, three-cornered eccentricity I had ever met, I
soon discovered his weak point, and did pretty much as I
pleased.&nbsp; I must here repudiate any insinuation that by this
I mean to imply he was to be squared.&nbsp; I might as well have
tried to square the Marble Arch.&nbsp; Besides which, I did not
require to, my supply being greater than my demand.</p>
<p>Our first duty was to proceed to the tool-house, and, armed
with shovels, wheelbarrows, baskets, etc., to commence grubbing
about.&nbsp; As a newcomer I was selected for the
&ldquo;barrer,&rdquo; and a heavier &ldquo;barrer&rdquo; I never
felt; but having knocked some paint off a gate, and rolled it
over a sacred <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>grass plot, my incapacity was so manifest that I was
disrated to a shovel.&nbsp; Here, too, I was lamentably ignorant,
and out of every spoonful I collected a third went into the
&ldquo;barrer&rdquo; and the remainder everywhere else.&nbsp; I
was, in fact, trying to emulate the scavengers one sees ladling
mud on wet days.&nbsp; The long shots they make have always
inspired me with admiration; their revels in the oceans of mud
exercised a fascination over me, causing me till now to overlook
the science that is required to produce such apparently simple
efforts.</p>
<p>I have often driven up the hill that runs outside the front of
the prison and fancied it was steep; that fancy has since been
confirmed, and I am now in a position to assert positively that
it is very steep, especially between the shafts of a
&ldquo;barrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A duty we were about to undertake one day was the weekly
overhaul of the head warder&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; I was spared
a share in this revolting exercise&mdash;I never knew
how&mdash;but was simply told I should not be required.</p>
<p>I had often sympathized with these gardeners long before I
joined them, when seeing them shaking the frowsy rugs and rags,
carpet slippers, <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>and other gimcracks, and dusting Mrs. Head
Warder&rsquo;s best Sunday willow-pattern teapot.&nbsp; My
general ignorance, too, in the various branches of scavengering
had become so apparent that I felt convinced I should be informed
that I &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t suit&rdquo;; but, thanks to the
consideration of the Governor and assistant surgeon, I was
retained, though otherwise employed.&nbsp; I was henceforth
entirely detached, and turned out into various portions of the
grounds, and told to do the best I could.&nbsp; My special
instructions were to annihilate a certain weed, for which purpose
I was armed with a knife, though I seldom used it for that
particular purpose.&nbsp; The effect of this weed on the funny
head gardener was very strange, and he would grind his teeth and
mutter at the very sight of one.&nbsp; I at once took the cue,
and feeling it would please him, besides showing my zeal, used
the strongest language I could lay tongue to whenever I detected
one.&nbsp; My zeal, I fear, often led me into mistakes, and
valuable clover and priceless dandelions were ruthlessly
sacrificed to my want of discrimination.&nbsp; These errors in
uprooting the wrong plants generally elicited a gentle <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>rebuke, but
the &ldquo;cussing&rdquo; at the hated fungus condoned my
offence.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was zeal, sir, zeal,&rdquo; and he began
to &ldquo;like that chap&mdash;he was willing, anxious
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the way I won the old boy&rsquo;s heart
was my love for old coins (as a fact, I know nothing about them,
and prefer the more modern specimens).&nbsp; It happened one day
he picked up a rusty coin&mdash;whether a button or an obsolete
farthing I cannot say.&nbsp; I boldly, however, pronounced it to
be a Henry the Seventh, said I would gladly pay five shillings
for one like it, rattled along about Museum Street, my
collection, etc., till he recognized a brother-collector, and a
bond of sympathy was established; and as he dropped the Henry the
Seventh into his pocket, he led me to understand he had many like
it at home.&nbsp; Whether he undertook a pilgrimage to Museum
Street I cannot say, but about a month later a coolness showed
itself in his manner towards me, which rather led me to suspect
he had.</p>
<p>I now found myself my own master.&nbsp; No one was specially
interested in my movements.&nbsp; I was on my own hook, and so
long as I appeared to be occupied when certain individuals were
going their <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>rounds, I was never interfered with; and as these
rounds took place at about the same hours daily, I mapped out my
occupation accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At 7.30 I was turned into a large lawn, with sloping banks on
three sides and railings on the fourth; between these and the
outer wall was a gravel walk that circumvented the prison.&nbsp;
A turnkey patrolled this walk day and night, armed with a
cutlass.&nbsp; I asked one of them one day what he should do if
he found anyone scaling the wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it was you, I should say,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool; you&rsquo;ll sprain your ankle
dropping down t&rsquo;other side.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
suppose it was some other chap?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah! then,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I should carve him about
a foot below the waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 8 and 9 parties of men were constantly passing to and
fro to their various work.&nbsp; I usually, therefore, devoted
that hour to contemplation, the selection of some half-a-dozen
weeds for future decapitation, and a general look round.&nbsp;
When things had settled down a bit, my knife came into
requisition, and proceeding to one of my hiding-places I selected
one piece of tobacco for immediate <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>use, and sliced enough for my
day&rsquo;s consumption.&nbsp; I had some of these holes in
various parts of the grounds, constructed of a slate floor about
three inches square, with bricks for the roof and sides.&nbsp; I
found them admirably adapted to resist rain, and many I daresay
are still in existence.&nbsp; This enjoyment lasted till 11, when
it became dangerous.&nbsp; (I was nearly choked on one occasion
by foolishly having a lump of tobacco in my mouth when suddenly
confronted by an official.)&nbsp; After dinner I had a good
hour&rsquo;s reading (the papers don&rsquo;t arrive before;
indeed, the postal arrangements are capable of considerable
improvement), and so the afternoon passed comparatively
pleasantly, between the daily paper, &rsquo;baccy, and the
sloping bank.&nbsp; I often felt amused at the thought of how
different all this was to what some people believed; and a
conversation I &ldquo;overheard&rdquo; in the previous January,
when one cad was explaining to his inebriated companion that
imprisonment with hard labour was worse than penal servitude,
came vividly to my recollection.&nbsp; On one of these sunny days
I was much amused by an outline of the day&rsquo;s telegrams as
given me by a friendly turnkey.&nbsp; It was the <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>day on
which the news of young Vyse&rsquo;s death whilst reconnoitring
Arabi&rsquo;s position reached England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them
Arabians are rum chaps; ah, and can shoot too, I tell yer: that
officer as was recognisizing&mdash;look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chewing was an accomplishment I did not acquire in a day;
indeed, it took me weeks.&nbsp; At first it made me absolutely
poorly, but I persevered, and eventually found it as agreeable as
smoking.&nbsp; I could not, however, manage the twist, and
invariably used the honey-dew or negro-head.&nbsp; This
daintiness was not unattended with inconvenience, as no shop in
the neighbourhood kept such a thing, and involved journeys to the
Strand or Oxford Street.&nbsp; I was never so foolish as to keep
the tobacco about me, and my cell was as free of it as any
hermit&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the grounds, however, it was perfectly
safe; tobacco under a stone might belong to anybody, and though
the suspicion would probably have cost me my staff appointment,
absolute conviction would have been impossible.&nbsp; To say that
I was free from some sort of suspicion would be hardly correct,
for although I was never searched myself&mdash;except on the one
<a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>occasion
before mentioned&mdash;my next-door neighbour was &ldquo;turned
over&rdquo; about twice a week.&nbsp; The reason that led to this
was as follows:&mdash;I had found this man specially
useful&mdash;he was quite a second Mike to me; anything I
required he did, and in return I gave him portions of my
superfluous food, and occasionally a piece of tobacco.&nbsp; This
traffic had not passed unnoticed, and had been communicated to a
warder by another prisoner, who felt himself aggrieved at the
preference shown by me for his fellow prisoner.&nbsp; These
sneakings are universally practised, and through my entire
experience I had to be careful of these wretches; they watched me
and hated me, and if they got the chance, always rounded on
&ldquo;The Swell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swell indeed!&nbsp; The swelling
had long ago subsided.&nbsp; I only weighed, thank heavens! about
fourteen stone.&nbsp; These sneakings never affected me, and one
of these individuals was once considerably astonished at getting
three days bread and water for a privileged communication about
me.&nbsp; A circumstance that occurred one day impressed me very
much on the matter of destiny, and the accidents that sometimes
combine to form a link <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>between two individuals that a month
or two previously would never have been dreamed of.&nbsp; It was
the day on which (the late) Dr. Lamson had been sentenced to
death.&nbsp; I was standing not far from the prison van, which
had lately returned after depositing him at the House of
Detention, and watching two prisoners cleaning it out.&nbsp; The
partition that he had occupied contained three or four pillows,
and I was informed it was a delicate attention on the part of the
Government to prevent condemned men intentionally injuring
themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are those pillows for?&rdquo; I
asked of a turnkey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re only Dr.
Lamson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was the facetious reply; &ldquo;he was
sentenced to-day, so we just put them in for fear he should chafe
himself, poor fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the cleaning was over my
brother reprobate led me to understand he had made a
discovery.&nbsp; Beneath the pillows he had found three cigars;
he considerately gave me one, as indeed prison etiquette
demanded, it being an axiom that an uncompromised holder of a
secret is never to be trusted.&nbsp; I certainly should not have
rounded on my <i>confr&egrave;re</i>, but was nevertheless very
glad to be the recipient of a specimen of this <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>&ldquo;Marwood&rdquo; brand.&nbsp; It was a sin to chew
them, but there was no alternative, as smoking was out of the
question.&nbsp; Half-an-hour later, as I bit off a piece, the
thought forced itself upon me, &ldquo;Three months ago, he at
Bournemouth, and I at Brighton, had never heard of one another,
and here I am chewing the condemned man&rsquo;s
tobacco.&rdquo;&nbsp; Funny thing, destiny!</p>

293</span>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CHURCH MILITANT IN PRISON.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Religious</span> ceremonial plays an
important part at Coldbath Fields.&nbsp; The quantity, indeed, is
lamentably in excess of the quality, and leavened with a degree
of barbaric hypocrisy incapable of engendering any feeling but
that of nausea.&nbsp; Language fails me in trying to describe it
in its proper light; and though reluctant to appear as scoffing
at religion&mdash;which I emphatically repudiate&mdash;what I saw
and heard makes it a hopeless task to allude to the subject and
yet divest it of its component parts.&nbsp; This cure of some
1400 (criminal) souls was vested in two chaplains, of whom one
had the misfortune to be a gentleman.&nbsp; I say
&ldquo;misfortune&rdquo; advisedly, for unless incapable of
contamination the most charitably inclined and refined is bound
to deteriorate.&nbsp; Their duties, in <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>addition to
those usually associated with clergymen, embraced a
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of the schoolmaster with a dash of the
district visitor, and if they were disposed (which all were not)
to throw in a slice of detective work, it was not considered a
disqualification for further preferment.&nbsp; The spiritual
welfare of the Protestant portion of the prisoners was divided
between them, all fresh arrivals during this month being
specially assigned to the one, and all coming in the next
devolving on the other.&nbsp; The etiquette and punctilio that
regulated this division when once made, was as marked as that
usually found amongst country medical practitioners.&nbsp; Thus,
if Sykes the burglar, who happened to be one of the Rev.
Smith&rsquo;s lambs, unfortunately cracked his skull, and was in
immediate want of spiritual consolation, he would in all
probability be requested to defer his departure till the arrival
of the Rev. Robinson.&nbsp; I mention this in regard to the
system, and not as referring to anyone in particular, although
the way I was ignored (very much to my delight) some weeks later,
when my particular pastor was on leave, fortifies me in the
conviction that my theory is correct.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>A
portion of the prisoners are visited daily by their respective
chaplains, and day after day, between ten and twelve, is devoted
to this solemn pilgrimage.&nbsp; That religion may be
administered in various forms was apparent from the method
pursued respectively by the two chaplains.&nbsp; The one seemed
to think that a kind word and a pleasant smile might safely be
addressed to the vilest criminal without detracting from his
spiritual dignity; the other relied implicitly on scowls and
frowns, and a recitation of the terrors of judgment and hell as
the proper ministration for miserable sinners.</p>
<p>I have special cause to be grateful for the accident that
assigned me to whom it did, as, being a Presbyterian, and never
having benefited to the extent of &ldquo;confirmation,&rdquo; I
should most assuredly have found my spiritual lines cast in
harder places under an uncompromising bigot of Episcopacy, than
under one who was willing to admit, that the kingdom of Heaven
was not specially reserved for members of the Church of
England.&nbsp; The multifarious calls on his time prevented my
chaplain from seeing me more frequently than once or <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>sometimes
twice in a fortnight; but even these occasional visits did not
pass unnoticed, and I gleaned, from a casual remark he once made,
that his spiritual superior considered a visit every two months
ample for the requirements of the most depraved outcasts.&nbsp; I
can only attribute this conclusion to the potency of his peculiar
ministration, which, unless taken in homoeopathic doses, might
possibly have been injurious to both body and soul.</p>
<p>I never came much in contact with the chief pillar of the
chapel, though I was made acquainted with his usual routine by
many of his flock:&mdash;&ldquo;What are you here for?&nbsp; Do
you say your prayers?&rdquo; were the soothing conundrums he
rapped out on his periodical visits; and if the answer was in the
negative, it was followed by &ldquo;D&rsquo;you know where
you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo; and then the door was slammed with
a reverence suitable to the occasion.&nbsp; The relief that
followed his exodus was, however, only momentary; and again the
key rattled in the door, and a head, with eyes flashing, was once
more thrust in, and yelled out, &ldquo;To hell!&rdquo;&nbsp; For
of such is the kingdom of Heaven!</p>
<p><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>Chapel was an infliction one was subjected to four
times a week.&nbsp; The service in its entirety was conducted
with a strict regard to official etiquette, and the degrees of
relative rank were as clearly defined by the Bibles and
prayer-books as by the seats, hassocks, reading desks, etc.,
allotted to the officials.&nbsp; Thus, the Governor&rsquo;s
Bibles and prayer-books were gilt-bound, with gilt clasps; the
deputy Governor&rsquo;s, Scripture-reader&rsquo;s, and
schoolmaster&rsquo;s, gilt bindings without the clasps; the
principal warders&rsquo;, clasps without the gilt binding; and
those of the rank-and-file of warders destitute of either gilt
binding or clasps.&nbsp; Prisoners had to content themselves with
thumbed, dog-eared, leafless specimens, and so the united
hallelujahs ascended to Heaven&mdash;let us hope equally
acceptable, whether dog-eared or gilded.&nbsp; The interior of
this sacred edifice resembled a barn, the nave being fitted up
with rows of backless benches capable of accommodating some 600
knaves, a yard apart.</p>
<p>A bird&rsquo;s-eye view of this congregation was one that
challenged reflection, comprising as it did young men and old,
dark and fair, short and stout, <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>tall and thin, lads with fluff, and
hoary-headed sinners, all stamped with the same mark of
Cain&mdash;hang-dog faces and protruding jowls, conical heads
with hair extending down the nape, bullet pates and cadaverous
faces, cripples and blind men, one-legged and one-armed, yet all,
with few exceptions, marked with the same indescribable jail-bird
brand never to be mistaken, and once seen never to be
forgotten.</p>
<p>The floor was tesselated (of the alms-house period), and one
of the hardest floors with which I had ever come in
contact.&nbsp; I realized this from a regulation that
necessitated one&rsquo;s grovelling on the slightest
provocation.&nbsp; The walls of this portion of the building were
of a bilious-official mud colour, the monotony of which was
occasionally relieved by scrolls and texts of a personal
nature.&nbsp; Beyond were a few steps leading to the pulpits and
pews for the higher officials; here the mural decorations assumed
a brighter form&mdash;indeed, paint seemed to have been laid on
regardless of expense, and with a degree of vulgarity I had never
seen equalled, except perhaps in Albert Grant&rsquo;s lately
pulled-down house at <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>South Kensington.&nbsp; The mania
for smearing the walls with texts was by no means confined to the
chapel, but was to be found everywhere that propriety and extreme
religious fervour seemed to suggest.&nbsp; Thus over the surgery,
as a reminder to possible schemers, &ldquo;lying lips&rdquo; were
very properly condemned; near the stores advice as to
&ldquo;picking and stealing&rdquo; was conspicuously displayed,
with about as much effect as if it had been placed in the
oakum-picking wards; and everywhere, conspicuous <i>by its
absence</i>, was the wholesome admonition, &ldquo;If any man
among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, this
man&rsquo;s religion is vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chapel, moreover, boasted of an organ&mdash;a serious
infliction, involving a temptation for the encouragement of
singing; and nobody that has not heard 600 malefactors without an
&ldquo;h&rdquo; in their composition bellowing &ldquo;&rsquo;Oly,
&rsquo;oly, &rsquo;oly,&rdquo; can sympathize to the extent the
occasion merits.&nbsp; I was peculiarly unfortunate in my usual
seat, which happened to be amongst the trades, and was flanked by
the blacksmiths.&nbsp; I never heard them yelling without
thinking that <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Harmonious Blacksmith&rdquo; must
have been a different sort, which in its turn gave way to the
&ldquo;four-and-twenty blackbirds that were baked in a
pie,&rdquo; and then I was recalled to the proximity of the
four-and-twenty blacksmiths by &ldquo;&rsquo;Oly, &rsquo;oly,
&rsquo;oly.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could have wept from sheer sympathy
when I heard that glorious &ldquo;Te Deum&rdquo; so brutally
massacred, and pitied the organist&mdash;an excellent
musician&mdash;for having to play on such an instrument to such
an accompaniment.</p>
<p>The entrance of the prisoners was not conducted on the
principle customary in places of worship (though I suppose no one
really associated this specimen with any attributes of the kind),
but was accompanied by the blowing of whistles, and shouts of
&ldquo;Move higher up!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come on, there!&rdquo;
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know where you are?&rdquo; &ldquo;This
ain&rsquo;t a music-hall!&rdquo; and such-like appropriate
exclamations.&nbsp; Music-hall indeed!&nbsp; The Middlesex
magistrates would never licence such an exhibition; indeed, it
only required a few handfuls of orange-peel to have made it a
formidable rival of &ldquo;The Vic.&rdquo; in its palmiest
days.</p>
<p>The chief cause of most of this indecent <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>behaviour
was one of the head warders, and when this man superintended the
chapel parade the scene was disgraceful; and &ldquo;Take that
man&rsquo;s name down!&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you to your
cell, sir!&rdquo; and bully, bully, bully, was the preparation
for the service.&nbsp; This is no exaggeration, and hundreds of
officials and prisoners will recognize the description.&nbsp; At
the same time it is only right to add that the Governor and
chaplains have no means of knowing of these daily outrages, for
custom regulates their entrance after the chapel is full, and
when a toadying, eye-serving, make-believe reverence has
succeeded the state of things I have described.&nbsp; The service
was happily not a long one, and twenty minutes was the average
duration from find to finish.&nbsp; It was conducted, I should
say, with a tendency to High Church formula on the part of the
clergy and a portion of the congregation.&nbsp; Thus, the
ministers, the laundrymen, and the blacksmiths invariably turned
to the east during certain portions of the service, whilst the
Governor (an old man-of-war&rsquo;s man, who could box the
compass as well as ever), myself (I could see the weathercock
from my window), the <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>needle-men, who followed me to a
man, and here and there a tailor, as persistently faced due
north.</p>
<p>The habit of trying to sing &ldquo;second&rdquo; was a very
severe trial to listen to, and I remonstrated with one old man
that I looked on as a kind of ringleader, at the pain his efforts
caused me.&nbsp; His voice was by way of being a tenor, and his
disregard of all harmony induced me to christen him
&ldquo;Wagner.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day poor old Wagner appeared with
his neck painted with iodine, and the feeble croaks that he
emitted, however painful to himself, were a considerable relief
to me.&nbsp; Remembering, too, that when the Devil is sick he is
supposed to be most susceptible of good impressions, and not
wishing to lose the opportunity of working on his feelings, I
determined to let him have it.&nbsp; I impressed on him the
brittleness of tenor voices in general; how susceptible their
metempsychosis was to disorganisation; how the epidermis of the
carotid artery was peculiarly sensitive; and, with a casual
glance at his neck, implored him for his own sake, if not for
mine, to give his voice a rest.&nbsp; With beads of perspiration
and iodine trickling down his back, he gasped compliance; and
thus I <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>reduced my &ldquo;crosses&rdquo; by one.&nbsp; Another
horrid old man never failed to irritate me.&nbsp; He was
undergoing twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment for inciting little
boys to steal, but was now on the religious tack.&nbsp; So
religious, indeed, had he become, that in a portion of &ldquo;The
Creed&rdquo; he could not say &ldquo;hell,&rdquo; but invariably
substituted &ldquo;the grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had never heard this
impertinent innovation before, and could have kicked him and his
hypocrisy into Wagner&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; Instantaneous
conversions, such as took place years ago during the so-called
Revivals, were of occasional occurrence, brought about, as I take
it, by the thrilling discourses we were sometimes treated to, and
the &ldquo;awakened one&rdquo; would stand up and hold
forth.&nbsp; But very short work was made of these converts, and
a couple of matter-of-fact warders soon trundled them out, to be
brought up later on and punished for disturbing the
service.&nbsp; I made a careful study of the two chaplains and
their respective peculiarities in conducting the service.&nbsp;
With the one I never had cause for annoyance, and though his
sermons could not be said to bristle with eloquence, he was
evidently in earnest, and <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>mindful of the fact that the word
Protestant embraced more denominations than one, and seemed
particularly careful not to outrage the feelings of the many
Presbyterians, Wesleyans, and other Nonconformists that formed a
portion of the congregation.&nbsp; The other reverend individual
had a partiality for the declamatory style, and whenever
circumstances, or the calendar, gave him the option of selecting
a psalm, never failed to declaim how &ldquo;Moab is my washpot,
over Edom will I cast out my shoe&rdquo; (Ps. cviii.).&nbsp; I
verily believe he used to think he was talking of his own
household effects, and the expressions of admiration on the faces
of the blacksmiths generally leave little or no doubt in my mind
that they were thoroughly convinced he was appraising the
contents of his charming little suburban retreat.&nbsp; But what
he revelled in were the commandments: &ldquo;Thou shalt&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; were balm to the holy man, and I
was always pleased to see him enjoying himself.&nbsp; A favourite
dodge amongst prisoners, now pretty well played out, is to
petition for a remission of sentence on the plea of conversion
and regeneration.&nbsp; That such a circumstance should be
flattering to <a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>the vanity of a man who is morally convinced of his
incapacity for converting anything, is not to be wondered at, but
the marvel is, how men with the varied experience of prison
chaplains (I speak generally) should be gulled by such shallow
artifices.&nbsp; That they are, however, is beyond dispute.&nbsp;
I have met and conversed with many of these brands plucked from
the burning, and my experience accords with that of many capable
of forming an opinion, that they are matchless both in cunning
and rascality.&nbsp; They are invariably tale-bearers, or what
are known in the comprehensive criminal vocabulary as
&ldquo;creepers,&rdquo; for they do creep up the back of any one
foolish enough to confide in them, and as surely creep down the
next official&rsquo;s who is mean enough to encourage their
tattle.&nbsp; These gentlemen are pretty well labelled, and I
made it a practice to always preface my conversation with any of
them by letting them understand they might tell
&ldquo;Gehazi,&rdquo; or any one they pleased, all and everything
I might happen to say.&nbsp; One glaring instance of the
converted type that I often led into conversation told me that he
was very sanguine on the subject of a remission of <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>the
remainder of his sentence; that one of the chaplains was
&ldquo;working it&rdquo; for him; and, indeed, that he and many
other likely to be well informed individuals, such as
assistant-turnkeys and fellow-prisoners may be presumed to be,
had assured him that his success was a foregone conclusion.&nbsp;
I asked him how he succeeded in getting such
&ldquo;powerful&rdquo; advocacy, and although at first he assumed
the fervent style, he very soon relapsed into his normal
condition on seeing that I looked on him as a humbug.&nbsp; He
then proceeded to explain that he began by expressing a desire to
see his chaplain in private, in hopes of satiating the thirst for
peace of mind that gave him no rest; that this led to salutary
advice and a fagot of tracts, and had ended in his partaking of
the Holy Communion&mdash;I almost hesitate to repeat this rank
blasphemy, and my only justification is its unexaggerated truth;
indeed, I would not dare to write such horrors unless fortified
by my veracity.&nbsp; He went on to add that it was awfully
jolly, and that he generally received any surplus that might
remain of the consecrated bread or wine.</p>
<p>I am indebted to him for the following details of <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>the custom
that prevailed on these solemn occasions, which, retailed in a
bantering style, may be briefly summed up as follows:&mdash;That
the ceremony was usually attended by one official of each
grade&mdash;such as the deputy governor, one chief warder, one
warder, and a turnkey&mdash;to whom it was administered according
to seniority; that the prisoners&rsquo; turn came next, and that
by a judicious foresight he usually managed to secure the first
place.&nbsp; He went on to add that he confidently expected some
cozy billet in the prison suitable to his serious tendencies, and
that his chaplain had promised to interest himself in procuring
him some situation on discharge.&nbsp; As we became more
intimate, he confided to me that he could never undergo poverty
and privation again, and was determined to attain affluence,
honestly if possible, but otherwise by one bold dash that should
attain his end, or qualify him for penal servitude.&nbsp; This
hopeful convert had been convicted of a till robbery, and had
moreover committed forgery, which had not been preferred against
him on condition that he restored the stolen money.&nbsp; It was
this last spontaneous (!) honourable act that formed the basis <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>of his
petition, proving his instantaneous remorse for the error of a
moment&mdash;a remorse that had since ripened into sincere and
heartfelt repentance.&nbsp; He concluded by informing me that his
chaplain had led him to understand he should probably give him a
few pounds on his discharge, but that he had been deceived so
often by &ldquo;converts&rdquo; he had assisted eventually
becoming &ldquo;convicts,&rdquo; that he hesitated to help any of
whose sincerity he was not perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; Let us hope
he has not again been a victim of misplaced confidence!&nbsp; I
have on more than one occasion found it difficult to maintain my
gravity when hearing this rogue and his victim discussing Bible
questions, and whining at the ridicule he had to submit to on
account of his convictions, and receiving consolation by the
quotation of the case of Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; I have no scruple
in giving this account, as the principal actor has long since
been discharged (but not on his petition, which was naturally
refused), and because it is an ungarnished, indisputable proof of
the deceptions practised by criminals, and goes a long way to
justify the apparently harsh treatment frequently accorded
them.&nbsp; That the chaplains are <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>a conscientiously disposed class may
be gleaned from the circumstance that on one occasion, when a
converted sinner after his discharge sent a <i>souvenir</i> in
the shape of an eighteen-penny <i>papier m&acirc;ch&eacute;</i>
inkstand, the reverend recipient declined to accept it till he
had first obtained the sanction of the visiting Justices.</p>

310</span>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOSPITAL DEAD-HOUSE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> my career as a gardener I
became very unwell.&nbsp; I attribute this in a measure to a
recurrence of a malady contracted in the tropics, and a chill I
caught from lying on damp grass in a draughty yard.&nbsp; Another
cause of my serious and probably life-long illness may possibly
be traced to an insane and spontaneous act&mdash;an over-taxation
of nature&mdash;many months previously.&nbsp; I had fined down in
the ordinary course of events to the weight and bulk (according
to my theory) that nature clearly intended; but not content with
this satisfactory result, I determined to attain still slimmer
proportions.&nbsp; Many indications convinced me I had found
&ldquo;my bearings,&rdquo; and common sense ought to have
suggested, <i>enough</i>; but vanity prevailed, and perseverance
attained the further desired <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>reduction, though at a more serious
price than I had contemplated.&nbsp; My theory on the reduction
of fat is based on my own case, and had I stopped as I recommend
others, when I had found &ldquo;my bearings,&rdquo; I should have
retained my usual health; as it was I went on and on, and like
those enthusiasts who sacrifice health and life to the perfecting
of a principle, so I, regardless of my own convictions, acted in
direct opposition to my advice to others, and may be
congratulated on having probed a theory to the very bottom at
considerable personal sacrifice.&nbsp; If any sceptic is disposed
to disparage my system, I ask him to blame me and not it.&nbsp;
The latter consists of a dietary in itself harmless, and certain
to produce diminution.&nbsp; When a certain point is attained it
says <span class="GutSmall">STOP</span>; and if it is asked why,
I reply because beyond that point it is rash, and if persisted
in, the theory is clearly not to blame.&nbsp; I am aware that
many will seize the opportunity to disparage the system, and
endeavour to deter others from following it.&nbsp; Such a course
would be as logical as to condemn a glass of sherry, because
someone had died from <i>delirium tremens</i>; or to abstain from
eels because Henry I. <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>had died from a surfeit of lampreys;
or, to carry the absurdity a degree further, to avoid (like the
old woman) apple-tart, because her husband had died of
apple-plexy.&nbsp; It was in the spring that I commenced my
campaign against nature, and though I had ample proof that I had
arrived at my &ldquo;natural bearings,&rdquo; I determined (never
dreaming of the danger) to persevere a little more.&nbsp; I was
then about 15 stone in weight, and knowing it was a stone in
excess of the average for men of my build, I thought if I could
reduce just one stone more I would rest satisfied.&nbsp; I found,
however, that my ordinary daily diet of mutton broth, a chop,
potatoes, bread, and cocoa failed to reduce me as it had hitherto
done, and that, try as I would, I recorded the same weight a
fortnight hence.&nbsp; The remedy that most naturally suggested
itself was to reduce the quantity, and I proceeded to divest my
consumption, of the broth, the fat from the chops, and a portion
of the potatoes and cocoa; but nature still continued to warn me,
and I as persistently ignored her, and, losing all patience, I
entered on a course little short of starvation.&nbsp; I took a
solemn oath that I would for one week <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>confine myself to six ounces of
bread and six mouthfuls of water a day (six ounces of bread will
be found to be synonymous to six mouthfuls, and no more).&nbsp;
During the first 48 hours my appetite became ravenous, and on the
third and fourth days the pains of hell did indeed get hold of
me; and it was as much as I could do to resist the temptation of
taking one mouthful of the savoury broth and mutton that was
lying untouched on my table.&nbsp; The trial now became almost
more than I could bear, and more than once I approached the
table, where the food would have to remain for an hour, but at
the last moment drew back.&nbsp; So acute, indeed, did I find
this agony that, to avoid temptation and to put it out of my
power, I used to throw the food into the slop-pail.&nbsp; After a
few days, the cravings of appetite began to cease, and I
congratulated myself that I was getting accustomed to it.&nbsp;
An accidental circumstance also prevented my testing the result
at the end of the seven days, and I continued in my madness for
another week.&nbsp; On being weighed I then found I had lost nine
or ten pounds.&nbsp; My appetite meanwhile had entirely forsaken
me; the smell and even the sight of meat <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>produced
nausea, my eyes seemed to be affected, my head began to swim, I
became giddy without cause.&nbsp; I was now really ill, and I
endeavoured to remedy the evil, but my stomach refused
nourishment, and if I ate I was immediately sick.&nbsp; The
possibility of having fatally injured myself so alarmed me that I
saw the surgeon, who prescribed tonics and a change of diet; and,
as all failed in restoring outraged nature, I was admitted into
hospital.&nbsp; During this time Dr. Tanner and his starvation
exhibition were constantly in my mind, and the man I had once
associated with the performance of a wonderful feat of
self-denial descended in my mind to the level of a poor sick man
like myself, absolutely incapable of taking food.&nbsp;
Starvation has an ugly sound, and in its first stages is
unquestionably painful; but in a very few days (three or four at
the most) the sensation passes away, and is succeeded by an
absolute aversion to food.&nbsp; When I have seen a half-starved
man in the streets who has told me he has not tasted food for a
week and was &ldquo;so &rsquo;ungry,&rdquo; my bowels of
compassion have always been moved.&nbsp; If any mendicant was to
tell me so now, I should <a name="page315"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 315</span>know he was lying and refuse to
assist him; but if he said he had not eaten for two days and was
in agony, I should pity him and give him sixpence if I had
it.&nbsp; I shall give a detailed account of my life in hospital,
and the incredible kindness and consideration I received, later
on.&nbsp; Meanwhile I will confine myself to the assertion, that
to such an extent had I injured myself that in six weeks I had
lost two stone.&nbsp; On one&rsquo;s admission into hospital one
is at once put to bed, and one&rsquo;s clothes removed.&nbsp;
This latter custom is intended to insure a proper compliance with
the regulation, until the doctor&rsquo;s sanction is obtained to
the contrary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sitting up&rdquo; has, however, been
found to be half way to &ldquo;going down&rdquo;; and, as
hospital is the goal to which all prisoners aspire, it does not
require much inducement to commend their observance of this
particular rule.&nbsp; The hospital consists of a large airy
ward, fitted up with twenty beds.&nbsp; Through this, and
communicating with a glass door, is a smaller room with three
large windows, which gave a clear view of the outer world from
Holborn Town Hall to St. Pancras Station.&nbsp; It was my good
fortune to be located here, detached and <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>alone, and
yet sufficiently near to see and hear all that was going
on.&nbsp; The menial duties of the hospital are performed by
three prisoners selected for good behaviour.&nbsp; These billets
are specially prized, and though associated with the most
unpleasant duties, offer facilities for eating and drinking
which, in the estimation of prisoners, cover a multitude of
drawbacks.&nbsp; These cleaners eat up everything; indeed, so fat
do they often become that it is a kind of unwritten rule that
when they have increased a stone in weight they revert to prison
life.&nbsp; The voracity they display is incredible, and until
they become too dainty to care for anything but the best, they
may daily be seen finishing eggs, tea, mutton, milk, beef tea,
pudding, and arrowroot promiscuously, as they pass from patient
to patient.&nbsp; The opportunity for this gluttony is unlimited,
and a glance at the fare I subsisted on for over five months will
convince the most sceptical that kindness and liberality can
exist even in a prison; indeed, I attribute my being alive now to
the tender care and medical skill I received, and can never
adequately express my gratitude to the surgeons and the entire
hospital staff.</p>

<p>Every item was the best that money could procure, and
unlimited in the supply, nor could I have <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>lived
better at a West-End hotel at thirty shillings a day; but my
health precluded my enjoying it, and I could not summon the
appetite for one-tenth of the dainties.&nbsp; Everything I left
was devoured by the cleaners, and I have seen these cormorants
gorging as if determined to burst rather than waste a
scrap.&nbsp; Mine was by no means an isolated case, for every one
was equally cared for, and it seemed as if a man had only to be
really ill to be made to forget that he had fallen amongst
thieves, and was now under the care of the good Samaritan.&nbsp;
Sick men are proverbially impressionable; but now, months after,
in a genial climate, surrounded by every comfort that a kind
mother can think of, and gradually regaining my strength, I
cannot look back on the past without feelings amounting almost to
veneration, as I remember the kind friend and skilful hand that
saved me from the jaws of death.&nbsp; The hospital is
unquestionably the best managed of the various departments in
Coldbath.&nbsp; I attribute this to the excellent staff of
experienced warders, and the supervision of the medical
officers.&nbsp; Where all seem actuated by the same desire, it
would be <a name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
319</span>invidious to draw comparisons; but the authorities
little know what hard-working, efficient, and trustworthy men
they have in their two night-warders, who week by week relieve
each other, and perform their multifarious duties through the
livelong night in a quiet, unostentatious way, and all for a
pittance of an extra shilling a night beyond that paid to an
ordinary turnkey.&nbsp; The many sleepless nights I passed gave
me ample time to study their habits, which never varied, nor
seemed regulated by eye-service; and from 6 in the evening, when
they appeared neatly attired in white jacket and apron, till 6 in
the morning, these living automatons neither slumbered nor slept,
but were engaged, without intermission, in dispensing medicines,
preparing plasters and poultices, and keeping up the fires,
without fuss or noise, and with the regularity of a
chronometer.&nbsp; At first my utter prostration prevented me
leaving my bed, but as time wore on, I began to get about and
observe what was going on.&nbsp; The day was a long and dreary
one, though it was optional when one got up, nor could it be
divested of the many annoyances that officialism&mdash;spiritual
and <a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>temporal&mdash;seemed unable to forego even in a
hospital.&nbsp; The chief culprit was the Scripture reader (as I
understood was his official designation, though I never saw or
heard him so engaged), who appeared regularly at 2 o&rsquo;clock,
and read a monotonous harangue, with a religious tendency
evidently intended to be entertaining.&nbsp; I should be sorry to
misjudge the worthy man, whom I am disposed rather to sympathize
with, as the passive instrument of an irreverent exhibition;
indeed, he conveyed to me the notion of a man actuated by a
strong desire to fulfil a duty conscientiously which he felt was
contemptible, and that deceived neither himself nor his
audience.&nbsp; This farce and its surroundings were all
sprinkled with the same reverential ceremony, and as he strutted
up the passage with his billycock under his arm, a subdued tone
pervaded the room and heads were uncovered as became the solemn
farce.&nbsp; &ldquo;The subject for our study and
meditation,&rdquo; began the unhappy man, &ldquo;is entitled,
&lsquo;Jonas, or the bilious whale,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Cain, the
naughty man,&rsquo;&rdquo; as the case might be; and then
followed twenty minutes of twaddle, senseless and monotonous, and
as <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>incapable of removing moral stains as would be
&ldquo;Thorley&rsquo;s Food for Cattle,&rdquo; if substituted in
things temporal (and seedy) for &ldquo;Benzine
Collas.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fervent &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; always followed
these effusions, loudly joined in by the cleaners, who felt it
might be considered a recommendation for continued hospital
employment, and those patients approaching convalescence, who
hoped it might turn the scale in favour of a few more days in
hospital.&nbsp; By opening the door I could see and hear
everything, and I often caught poor &ldquo;Bubbling Bill&rdquo;
casting sheep&rsquo;s eyes in my direction.&nbsp; Meals were
always preceded by a grace (?) said by a turnkey: &ldquo;Bless O
lor&rsquo; th&rsquo; things touruse for crysake, Amen!&rdquo; a
refreshing and commendable adjunct.</p>
<p>It seems peculiarly unfair on religion that it should so often
be presented in a hideous or ridiculous light, and if the same
stipulations were enforced as to quality as at present exist as
to quantity, more things than time might possibly be saved.</p>
<p>At 11, and again at night, the surgeons visited the hospital,
when every case was carefully gone <a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>into.&nbsp; The care that prisoners
receive in this hospital puts crime almost at a premium, and
though I may indirectly be accusing those eminent and otherwise
irreproachable physicians of unintentionally aiding and abetting
law-breaking, veracity compels me to say what I think.&nbsp; A
case I met goes far to prove it.&nbsp; In the hospital with me
was a broken-down old gardener who had seen better days, and was
in receipt of a pension of five shillings a week from a former
employer.&nbsp; This pittance, however conclusive it might be of
his comparative honesty, was wholly inadequate to procure medical
comforts for rheumatic gout, to which he was a martyr.&nbsp; He
next appears at a police court for having a pig in his yard,
which he had driven in from the street, and then informed the
police.&nbsp; There can be only one solution of this act, for he
was a man of sixty, beyond absolute want, and had never seen the
inside of a prison before.&nbsp; He had now attained his object,
and was undergoing three months&rsquo; imprisonment, during all
which time he was in hospital.&nbsp; I saw him on admission, a
cripple, crumpled up and half-starved, and I saw him every day
swaddled in cotton wool, <a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>his limbs frequently fomented, and
fed on the daintiest luxuries.&nbsp; This man was one of the few
I met who was grateful for the care bestowed on him, and honest
enough to wish he had had six instead of three months&rsquo;
imprisonment.&nbsp; I saw him on the day of his discharge,
comparatively cured, and wondered how long it would be before he
again caught the right sow by the ear.&nbsp; A disadvantage that
patients have to suffer from is the architectural construction of
the ward: it unites the two angles of the prison, and
necessitates its being traversed in its entire length by every
official going his rounds.&nbsp; On these occasions great
inconsideration is shown, the orange-peel delinquent of chapel
notoriety being peculiarly offensive in the unnecessary noise he
made.&nbsp; I heard him on one occasion complain to the warder,
that a patient, who was almost <i>in extremis</i> at the time,
was &ldquo;too lazy to look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During my retirement I saw more than one painful death-scene;
the one that made the most unpleasant impression on me was that
of a living skeleton, who seemed incapable of dying, although too
weak to do anything but blaspheme dreadfully, <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>and keep up
one incessant groan.&nbsp; He was a man of sixty, and had been in
his time the best known and expertest of swell-mobsmen.&nbsp; He
had not a relation in the world, and although offered his
discharge months before, had nowhere or no one to whom he could
go.&nbsp; I saw this man dying for weeks, and eventually stood at
his bedside when he took his last gasp.&nbsp; This man had been
either a convict or undergoing imprisonment for the last twenty
years, and the crime that led to his death in Coldbath was the
sacrilege of putting a counterfeit half-crown into a collection
plate, and taking out as change a genuine florin.&nbsp; One of
the cleaners&mdash;an unmitigated thief, but sufficiently good to
have qualified for staff employ&mdash;had told the warder the day
before his death that he knew him to be acquainted with certain
persons he named; and with the consideration that characterizes
the treatment of prisoners in hospital, no pains were spared to
discover the creatures.&nbsp; I saw them next day (two females,
known to every policeman in London, the one as the keeper of a
thieves&rsquo; lodging-house, the other as a
&ldquo;decoy&rdquo;), actuated by no motive but curiosity and the
intimation they had <a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>received, standing at the dying
man&rsquo;s bed in their tawdry finery, in company with the
priest as attired in chasuble and stole he pronounced the extreme
unction for dying sinners.&nbsp; The dying man, the kindly
priest, the tawdry females, and the surroundings, formed a
picture truly awful, and baffling description.&nbsp; But the end
had not yet come; and as the room was again left to its normal
condition, banter reassumed its sway, and bets began to be made
as to the probable hour of his death.&nbsp; Pots of tea and
bread-and-butter were freely wagered, and yet through the
livelong night the dying groans, getting feebler and feebler,
told how the swell-mobsman was still tussling with death.&nbsp;
At five in the morning the end was evidently at hand, and
slipping on my clothes, I joined the knot of men attracted to the
bedside.&nbsp; The man was happily unconscious; and as the
excitement of the sweepstake increased, I can only compare it to
the game of roulette, when the ball almost rolls into one
compartment and then topples into the next; and &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
dead now,&rdquo; &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his last,&rdquo; followed gasp after gasp,
till at a few minutes to six a profound silence <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>announced
that the swell-mobsman was gone.&nbsp; (It is only fair to state
that much of this occurred unknown to the solitary warder, for
what was one amongst so many?)&nbsp; By this time the prison bell
was ringing, and the place was astir as day and night warders
relieved one another.&nbsp; To stretch, strip, and carry him out
of bed were the work of a moment; and what had been a living man
a few seconds before had been washed, laid out, rolled in a
blanket, and carried to the dead-house in less time than I have
taken to write it.</p>
<p>The washing and laying out of a corpse is too dreadful to pass
unnoticed.&nbsp; This necessary but revolting ceremony is
performed in the kitchen.&nbsp; I saw the corpse divested of all
clothing, lying on the top of the bath, in the centre of the
kitchen, with the kettle boiling within a yard of it, and
surrounded by pots and pans and other paraphernalia in daily
use.&nbsp; The stench that pervaded the kitchen after this
ceremony was so apparent (nor could it be got rid of for days)
that I was absolutely unable to eat anything that had passed
through it, and for days subsisted on the insides of <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>loaves and
eggs, as the only places where the flavour of potted pickpocket
did not appear to have penetrated.&nbsp; This washing of corpses
and the &ldquo;itch bath&rdquo; in a hospital kitchen is as great
a scandal as ever was perpetrated by any Government.</p>
<p>The dead-house is a primitive establishment, and cannot even
be divested of superfluous officialism.&nbsp; Its entire contents
consist of a slab and a wooden block for the head of the corpse,
and yet it boasted of an inventory board.&nbsp; This latter
absurdity is conspicuously displayed, and reads&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;ONE
TABLE.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;ONE BLOCK.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another death I saw was even more awful in its
suddenness.&nbsp; It was during dinner when some five or six
patients were devouring their chops.&nbsp; One man, that was
conspicuous for his habitual voracity, had left the table whilst
waiting for the pudding.&nbsp; As he passed his bed he toppled
over and was dead.&nbsp; The cook, with the characteristic
officiousness of the criminal class, rushed out of the kitchen <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>with a
saucepan full of rice pudding in his hand, and began to assist at
the ghastly manipulation.&nbsp; I was within a foot of him, and
saw the wretch brush off a tear from the dead man&rsquo;s eye,
which he then proceeded to close; he then resumed his culinary
duties, and gave the saucepan a stir.&nbsp; Rice pudding, I
understand, is liable to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the pot; for my
part, I made a vow to &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to dry bread; indeed, I
never see one now without being reminded of this disgusting
scene.</p>
<p>I was now beginning to yearn for tobacco.&nbsp; For some days
past my illness had indisposed me for it; besides, my
arrangements had been upset by my sudden admission into
hospital.&nbsp; To communicate with one of my agents, although by
no means difficult, was a question of opportunity.&nbsp; I was
particularly anxious, too, not to be suspected of breaking a
rule, for though it could only have been interpreted as a breach
of discipline to be dealt with by the Executive, I found it
difficult to divest myself of the notion it would appear
ungracious towards my kind physicians if I transgressed any rule
whilst in hospital.&nbsp; But my craving increased, and as I
could not eat, and to smoke I was afraid, <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>and
consoling myself with the assurance that what the eye does not
see, the heart does not feel, I decided, in the burning words of
Bishop Heber, to &ldquo;mind my eye and blaze away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My position necessitated my breaking a fundamental rule of my
principle, and I confided in a rascally cleaner.&nbsp; I had,
indeed, no alternative, for, though by the confidence I increased
the chances of detection, I minimized and almost precluded the
possibility of the ownership being brought home to me.&nbsp; My
first anxiety was to find a place, for between my mattresses was
out of the question, and I at length decided on the flooring; but
selecting a plank and removing the nails are two different
things, and I should have been defeated at the very outset.&nbsp;
Chance, however, favoured me; and one day, to my great delight, a
ram was caught in the thicket, in the shape of a carpenter, come
to repair a window.&nbsp; As opportunity offered, I pointed out
to him a short plank, and leaving the room, said, &ldquo;I shall
be back in ten minutes; meanwhile, if you remove those nails, and
replace the plank so as not to be observable, I&rsquo;ll give you
as much grub as you can carry away.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
instructions <a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>would have been ample, but fearing his zeal to earn the
food might outrun his discretion, I popped my head in and added,
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re caught messing about, kindly remember I
know nothing about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This will hardly be deemed
chivalrous, though strictly in accordance with etiquette in giddy
Clerkenwell.&nbsp; Being satisfied with his work, but dreading to
explore my secret cave, I told a cleaner to collect all the spare
bread-and-butter he could find.&nbsp; So well did he carry out my
request that he shortly appeared with thirty-eight slices, but so
bulky was the quantity that it was necessary to smuggle it in,
and the coal-scuttle was pressed into the service; but my
carpenter did not object, and, removing the lump that concealed
it from the vulgar (turnkey) gaze, proceeded to devour it.&nbsp;
With his mouth full of one slice and shoving in another, he
occasionally gargled out, &ldquo;This is a treat!&rdquo;
&ldquo;This is jam!&rdquo; until sixteen slices had
disappeared.&nbsp; He now began to show signs of distress, and
secreted the rest inside his shirt; but what between the sixteen
slices inside and the twenty-two outside, his dimensions had so
increased that detection was a certainty.&nbsp; I therefore
refused <a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>to let him leave unless he swallowed eight
more&mdash;just to make an even two dozen&mdash;and the unhappy
man again began.&nbsp; I can see him now, sitting on the
window-sill, pretending to hammer, his eyes starting out of his
head, imploring me to &ldquo;let it be;&rdquo; but I was firm,
and had not the remotest intention of jeopardising my position by
any such weakness.&nbsp; As the last piece disappeared, he was
speechless, and I almost feared he was choked; but my mind was
considerably relieved by his asking me, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,
to give him a drop of water.&nbsp; But there was none in the
room, and, telling him it was all nonsense, and that the walk
downstairs would make it all right, saw him leave the room with
considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>That evening I explored my cavern, which surpassed my fondest
expectations; the architect must have put it there on purpose, so
admirably was it adapted.&nbsp; Lifting up the eighteen-inch
plank, I discovered a hollow place about six inches deep and two
feet square.&nbsp; I now lost no time in getting my supplies,
and, making a bag, at once filled it with paper, envelopes, a
knife, pencil, and <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>a cake of tobacco.&nbsp; From 6 to 7 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span> was my favourite hour for writing
and other business.&nbsp; I then carefully replaced my treasures,
and sent off my letters, leaving nothing criminating about me
except five or six atoms of tobacco, which I would have swallowed
rather than that they should have been discovered.&nbsp; There
were several advantages connected with a choice of this
hour.&nbsp; In it one was perfectly safe from interference; so
busy, indeed, was everybody, that the orange-peel man, who was
busy counting and inspecting, and the other officials sending off
night reports, would never have dreamt of anyone devoting this
particular hour to the breach of a dozen rules.</p>
<p>As time wore on, I began to dread the detection of my
hiding-place; so conspicuous, too, did it appear to my guilty
conscience that I determined to abandon it.&nbsp; The light
seemed to pour on its well-worn crevices, the Governor stood on
it twice or thrice a week, the surgeons crossed it a dozen times
a day, warders absolutely hovered over it all day long; so I
communicated with the cleaner, and entered into an arrangement
whereby, for a consideration of food and a piece of tobacco
daily, he <a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>was to secrete my bag elsewhere.&nbsp; I felt it was
madness to trust a confirmed thief, but there was no alternative;
and within a week I discovered the fallacy of there being any
honour amongst thieves, and the brute I had treated with the
greatest liberality stole my bag, and came to me with a whining
tale of how it had been discovered and taken away.&nbsp; It never
alarmed me, as it would had I really believed him; and shortly
after the whole conspiracy was revealed to me by about the only
reliable prisoner amongst them, and I had undoubted proof of the
complicity of every cleaner in the place.</p>

<p>My weary afternoons I usually beguiled by pantomimic
love-passages with a frowsy damsel in a neighbouring house.&nbsp;
Our acquaintance began as I watched a portion of her graceful
form bulging over a window-sill she was cleaning at the time,
which ripened into such an intimacy, that day by day we looked
out for each other, and exchanged such protestations of devotion
as might be conveyed by her holding up to me portions of her
employer&rsquo;s eatables, such as eggs and once a steak, which I
gracefully reciprocated by exposing Government <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>property,
such as a medicine bottle and occasionally
bread-and-butter.&nbsp; Graceful Selina! may my successor have
been more worthy of your innocent virgin heart!</p>

335</span>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BURGLARS &ldquo;I HAVE
MET.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> number of admissions into
hospital about this time necessitated my having a companion
billeted on me, an unfortunate Frenchman, utterly oblivious of
any language but his own; and as it turned out that his
attainments in English were exactly of the same extent as that of
the warders in French, there seemed to be an impassable gulf
fixed between all communication of ideas, if either party had
happened to possess any.&nbsp; He was complaining to me one day
of the disadvantage he laboured under, and described the usual
conversation that took place daily between himself and the
hospital warder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave; mon ami</i>.&nbsp; What do you
tink?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>My
companion, I was gratified to observe, was gradually mastering
some of the idioms of our language.</p>
<p>Not long after, an extraordinary creature was admitted as a
patient, and I cannot to this day say what his nationality was,
although I am inclined to believe his language was some kind of
Russian <i>patois</i>.&nbsp; Nobody could make head or tail of
him, and a distracted warder, in this dilemma recollecting my
success with the &ldquo;other foreigner&rdquo; and doubtless
giving me credit for a knowledge of every language of the earth
besides a few of the lunar ones, came and asked me to try and
understand him.&nbsp; My knowledge of outlandish languages is not
remarkably extensive (it is confined, I may state, to the
Hottentot word for &ldquo;rice&rdquo; and the Chinese for
&ldquo;smoke&rdquo;), and as no one appeared to have a Russian
dictionary, I addressed him in Hindustani, considering that in
point of longitude it came geographically nearest the
Russian.&nbsp; He at once replied in a rambling speech, throwing
his arms about and beating his chest; and though I am convinced
he understood no more of my speech than I had of his, my
reputation was established, the more so as he had no means of <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>betraying
my secret.&nbsp; Having then explained to the warder that he
complained of pains in the chest, and would prefer an egg beaten
in his tea instead of boiled (a change I considered unlikely to
materially affect his complaint), I retired to my apartment.</p>
<p>I now for the first time came into personal collision with the
chaplain.&nbsp; For weeks and months circumstances, and possibly
choice, had kept us apart, nor had we exchanged a word since the
eventful day when he discovered that an &ldquo;unconfirmed&rdquo;
sinner stood before him.&nbsp; It was during prayers (a movable
feast indulged in three mornings a week at the chaplain&rsquo;s
convenience) that I was referring to a book on the table in hopes
of finding the particular extract he was reading.&nbsp; Failing
in that I replaced the book, and resumed my hypocritical
solemnity, in blissful ignorance of any impropriety.&nbsp; The
holy man, however, thought otherwise, and hissed out at
me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider your behaviour impertinent to me, and
disrespectful to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first I retained my equanimity, for he was incapable of
raising my ire; and I assured him what my object had been, and
reminded him I was <a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>a Presbyterian.&nbsp; At this his rage knew no bounds,
and sneering in a manner unworthy of a clergyman (I won&rsquo;t
say a gentleman), he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Presbyterian, are you?&nbsp; Ah, I thought you
didn&rsquo;t belong to the Church of England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I soon got the unhappy man&rsquo;s back up.&nbsp; I assured
him I was indifferent to his opinion, and added I was proud to
belong to a Church where such intolerant views were not expressed
by its ministers.&nbsp; This undignified scene was heartily
enjoyed by twenty prisoners and warders, all of whom assured me I
had had considerably the best of it.&nbsp; I intended to have
paraded him before the visiting Justices, but common sense
prevailed, and I should have ignored his further existence had it
not been for a petty spite he indulged in shortly after.&nbsp; As
I have before stated, the library books are under his special
care.&nbsp; During my long illness I had waded through this
&ldquo;special&rdquo; catalogue till I had reached number 21, and
in the course of events might naturally hope to receive number 22
next.&nbsp; In this, however, I had made a miscalculation, and
his Reverence decided that a school edition (the eighth I had
read) of the History of England was a more wholesome dietary for
a <a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
339</span>bumptious Presbyterian.&nbsp; I was convinced the
mistake was not unintentional, but, anxious to give him an
opportunity of gracefully retracting a contemptible action, I
sent the following day to point out his oversight.&nbsp; The
reply was, as I expected, &ldquo;If he does not choose to have it
let him go without.&rdquo;&nbsp; I reported the matter to the
Governor, who at once offered to place the matter before the
visiting Justices, as he had no jurisdiction in the matter; but I
decided that the man and his book were neither worth it.&nbsp; I
should now, under ordinary circumstances, have been left entirely
bookless&mdash;a contingency in my case that did not occur.&nbsp;
It also gave me the opportunity of reading &ldquo;The General
History of the Church,&rdquo; a well-written and exhaustive work
by the Abb&eacute; Daras, supplied for the use of Roman
Catholics.&nbsp; The superiority of the
literature&mdash;religious and profane&mdash;selected and
supplied by the Roman Catholic chaplain, together with his
personal merit and gentlemanly bearing, makes Romanism a
formidable rival to the &ldquo;Established&rdquo; Religion as
dispensed at Coldbath.&nbsp; To judge by the jealousy that exists
in a certain quarter, it is evident this superiority is realized
elsewhere.&nbsp; But the <a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>circumstance was not unnoticed by my
lynx-eyed, ghostly comforter.&nbsp; On many occasions I have seen
him watching, as if he would have liked&mdash;had he
dared&mdash;to ask me what I was reading; but he confined himself
to discussing me with the warders, with such remarks as, &ldquo;I
see he&rsquo;s got hold of something,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s reading?&rdquo; all of which
was duly reported to me.&nbsp; I feel I have given undue
importance to this contemptible squabble; but I look on it as a
tilt between sects, a tussle between an Episcopalian divine,
armed with authority, and a Nonconformist, placed at a
considerable disadvantage, and where&mdash;had I been in a
position to do so&mdash;I should have left the room&mdash;as the
Governor once did the Chapel when unmeasured and ill-advised
criticism was being lavished on Dissenters.&nbsp; The guilt of
schism lay heavily on this orthodox Churchman&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; I say schism, for I call it such of the most
culpable type that ignores the insignia of Divine sanction
accorded to the Ministry and people of Nonconformity.&nbsp; I
would ask this bigoted Episcopalian what he thinks of Richard
Baxter, Livingston, John Horne, Wesley, Whitfield, Chalmers,
Candlish, Caird, Guthrie, McLeod, names only to be <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>mentioned
to inspire veneration, and yet these were all Nonconformists of
one denomination or another.&nbsp; Surely, if Divine grace finds
and fashions such men, they may be considered as entitled to at
least respect from clergymen and gentlemen, who, if they do not
agree in their respective tenets, may at least abstain from
unmeasured abuse of them and their followers!&nbsp; Arrogance
anywhere is bad, but is doubly so when men who claim to be
disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus set such an example by
their narrow-minded remarks about Nonconformity.&nbsp; The Church
of England is a venerable and illustrious section of the true
Church, and unlikely to have its fair fame sullied by the ravings
of a nameless ranter.&nbsp; But it becomes a question, is a
chaplain with such extreme views, so uncompromising in his
denunciations, so unguarded in his language, so ungovernable in
his temper, the sort of person for a prison chaplain, or one
likely to convert sinners from the error of their ways?&nbsp; God
forbid that my remarks should be mistaken.&nbsp; I do not aspire
to be considered either a ranter or a hypocrite, but I respect
and never fail to detect religion, and despise its base
counterfeit wherever and in whomsoever I find it; and if I can
hear the <a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>&ldquo;old story&rdquo; ungarnished by rhetoric, I care
not whether it emanates from Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or
Nonconformist of whatever denomination.</p>
<p>That this is a very small world was demonstrated to me during
a conversation I once had with a fellow prisoner.&nbsp; He was a
decent, educated man, and had been in a pawnbroker&rsquo;s
establishment.&nbsp; Our conversation one night turned on things
theatrical, and he was giving me some interesting experiences of
the &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; he had met at various times on
business.&nbsp; He asked me if I knew Mrs. &mdash;, and I said I
had spoken to the old hag.&nbsp; He then proceeded to tell me
what a constant customer she had been in former days, and how her
contributions had varied from woollen rags one week to valuable
jewellery another.&nbsp; It was then that a circumstance was
brought to my mind&mdash;told me some three years ago by a lovely
and accomplished actress, since retired from the stage&mdash;of
how a popular burlesque artiste in the same theatre had once lost
a valuable jewel, and how suspicion pointed at this identical old
woman, who had a girl at the theatre.&nbsp; I asked him if he
recollected anything about it, and he at once proceeded to give
me details that convinced me that <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>the pendant he referred to was one
and the same as that which had mysteriously disappeared, and that
the suspicions formed a few years ago might have been very fully
confirmed had a visit been paid to an establishment not a hundred
miles from Tottenham Court Road.</p>
<p>During my illness I had at different times the services of the
various cleaners in making my bed, brushing the floor, and
bringing in my meals, and I invariably extracted anything of
interest about their previous careers.&nbsp; My first was an
unmitigated young &ldquo;till thief.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a
special branch of the profession, requiring assurance rather than
dexterity, and consists in watching your opportunity when the
shop is empty, and then making a dash for the till or
cash-box.&nbsp; My valet had apparently been eminently fortunate,
and although he had undergone a previous twelve months, had
escaped detection a score of times.&nbsp; He was then undergoing
a lengthened seclusion for an unforeseen occurrence, which he in
no way considered as a reflection on his prowess.&nbsp; He had,
it appears, entered a confiding lamp-dealer&rsquo;s, and finding
the shop conveniently empty, and the cashbox conspicuously
displayed, had done his <a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>business, and proceeded to leave the
premises.&nbsp; A swinging glass door, however, unfortunately
intervened between the shop and the street, which in the
excitement he pushed the wrong way, and in some way jammed.&nbsp;
This little delay made a difference in his and the
shopman&rsquo;s respective accounts of about &pound;45.&nbsp; On
another occasion he found himself in a
corn-chandler&rsquo;s&mdash;a class that is proverbially
considerate in avoiding superfluous obstacles to a hurried
exit,&mdash;and whilst helping himself to the till, a customer
came in, who, seeing him engaged, asked for a pennyworth of
barley; to this he obligingly served her, added the cumbrous coin
to his other findings, and then complacently left the shop.&nbsp;
This individual was a special pet with the turnkeys, and as
such&mdash;combined with his trustworthy reputation&mdash;was
invariably selected for expeditions to the various stores.&nbsp;
His special talent here stood him in good stead, and he never
returned without having stolen three or four eggs, a handful of
flour, or a lump of soap.&nbsp; Indeed, so inherent was the
spirit for thieving, that if all else failed, he would annex
physic, and I have often seen him with bottles of quinine and
iron mixture.&nbsp; This latter forms a considerable <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>article of
commerce, and is much sought after and bartered (never mind how
or where) for advantages of a more palatable type.&nbsp; A short
time before his discharge I advised him to drop the cash-box
game, and he assured me he had quite determined to &ldquo;turn it
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within a week he had been re-convicted, and is
at present undergoing seven years&rsquo; penal servitude.&nbsp;
In my next valet I was considerably disappointed.&nbsp; Although
an unmitigated thief, I fancied I detected some redeeming
features.&nbsp; I talked to him frequently, and treated him with
as much kindness as a man with my circumscribed means had
probably ever been able to.&nbsp; In return he assisted to rob me
of contraband things, of which he always had a liberal
share.&nbsp; He had been a lieutenant (in burglary) of the late
Mr. Peace, and often discussed that eminent man with evident
regret.&nbsp; He had been with him in various minor affairs, and
through his entire career had never been
&ldquo;nabbed.&rdquo;&nbsp; His present incarceration was the
result of treachery, where a less fortunate associate had rounded
on him, and he was arrested a week after.&nbsp; He often hoped to
meet him outside, though an incident that occurred will
necessitate a postponement of the pleasure.&nbsp; A <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>batch of
convicts, <i>en route</i> to penal servitude, were one day being
medically examined by the surgeon (a new regulation lately come
into force), amongst whom my valet recognised his <i>quasi</i>
friend, the informer.&nbsp; The interview took place near the
kitchen, where my man was cooking a chop, the surgery being next
door, at which the convicts were ranged.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
did you say?&rdquo; I enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;I slapped my stomach to show &rsquo;im I was all
right, and then I says, &lsquo;You looks &rsquo;orrid ill, you
&mdash;; you&rsquo;ll never do it; thank God, &rsquo;twill kill
yer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant prelude to ten years&rsquo; penal servitude.</p>
<p>I am indebted to this noble-minded creature for many hints as
to how burglaries are concocted and how best guarded against, and
I am of opinion that attention to them will do more to obviate
their frequency than all the absurd warnings as to window
shutters and area gates, that periodically emanate from Scotland
Yard.&nbsp; No burglary is ever attempted on chance; in fact, no
house is ever entered except on exact and reliable
information.&nbsp; This is usually obtained through a frivolous
maidservant (in which case a delay of weeks may be necessary for
love-making), a rascally butler, or the <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>local
chimney-sweep.&nbsp; The information chiefly sought after is the
strength of the garrison (whether males or females), the class of
valuables (whether plate or jewellery), their usual locality, and
the habits of the occupants.&nbsp; With this as a basis, the
house is watched for days and weeks, in order that a confirmation
of the information may be obtained.&nbsp; The time preferred is
when the night police are in the act of relieving the day men,
and if that should be inconvenient (to the burglar), between the
night patrols.&nbsp; All this may appear ridiculous, but I give
it as the testimony of a notorious burglar, imparted to me in
good faith, under exceptionally favourable circumstances for
hearing the truth, and if acted on will materially increase the
security of householders.</p>
<p>I asked my mentor his opinion about window shutters and door
bolts, at which he absolutely laughed.&nbsp; No burglary is ever
attempted through a window unless considerately left open.&nbsp;
The front door is the invariable point of attack, as most
favourable for ingress and a precipitate retreat, and under
occasional circumstances the area.&nbsp; The operation never
takes more than twenty minutes, as is erroneously supposed, the
object being to be in and out again between the periodical
promenade <a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>of the policeman.&nbsp; These nocturnal strolls are
accurately calculated, and the precision with which they are
performed, however admirable from a disciplinary point of view,
are totally inappropriate as deterrents to burglaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;a person said to
you, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only got so-and-so in the house&mdash;you
can have that&rsquo;: would you be satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, we knows
jolly well what there is afore we comes; and, for the matter of
that, there&rsquo;s no time for talk.&nbsp; We goes straight for
the swag, and if anyone tries to &rsquo;inder us, we&rsquo;re
bound to let &rsquo;im &rsquo;ave the jemmy right across the
face.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s &rsquo;ow poor Peace got &rsquo;imself
into trouble fust.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went on to tell me that
he had a lovely (!) little jemmy about eighteen inches long and
tipped with the finest tempered steel, capable of being carried
up the sleeve, and so fine that it could be inserted into the
smallest crack or hinge; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;once
let me get &rsquo;is nose in, and make no mistake, I walks in
very soon arter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gentleman&rsquo;s testimony is worthy of
consideration.&nbsp; He was associated, as he informed me, with
the butler in a well-known burglary of plate <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>somewhere
in Kensington, and where the butler, being knave enough to rob
his master, was fool enough to entrust a large portion of the
proceeds to his confederate to melt down and divide.&nbsp; As I
understood him, half only of this bargain was carried out in its
integrity.</p>
<p>The secrecy with which foolish women fancy they put away their
jewels in secure safes let into the wall is a labour lost in
vain.&nbsp; Their hiding-place is thoroughly well known, and
probably its value, and other useful particulars.&nbsp; That they
have hitherto escaped is merely an accident of time and
opportunity; that they will ultimately be victimized is a
foregone conclusion.&nbsp; The moral to be gleaned from this is,
to be sure of your servants, a fool being almost as dangerous as
a knave, and to abstain from flashing your jewellery before eager
eyes, only too ready for a clue to its whereabouts.</p>
<p>If after this disinterested advice unprotected women are fools
enough to barricade themselves and their treasures in defenceless
houses, they have only themselves to thank.&nbsp; They should be
careful, however, not to waste their visitor&rsquo;s time when
confronted by his &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s-eye,&rdquo; as burglars are
<a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>proverbially children of impulse.&nbsp; Houses
containing little or nothing of value are never burglariously
entered.&nbsp; Men won&rsquo;t risk penal servitude on a chance;
the prize and its price have been carefully calculated.</p>
<h2><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;JUSTICE TEMPERED WITH
MERCY.&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> now been many months in
hospital, though all the care and kindness I received seemed
incapable of improving my condition.&nbsp; Strengthening
medicines, stimulants, tonics, all failed to rouse me, and the
tempting food, that I had only to suggest to have provided, could
not induce me to eat.&nbsp; I was subjected to a minute medical
examination, and my lung was found to be affected.&nbsp; Later on
a further examination proved that the malady was slowly
progressing.&nbsp; To remain in prison was certain death, so my
case was submitted to the Home Secretary, who, with the humanity
that has characterised his tenure of office, ordered my immediate
discharge.&nbsp; I shall never forget the morning when an
impulsive turnkey rushed into my room, and saying,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come!&rdquo; hurriedly disappeared, and I
understood that her Majesty&rsquo;s gracious pardon had arrived,
and I was free.</p>
<p><a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>The
preliminaries for departure were somewhat long in my case, and it
was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock before I bade adieu to gloomy
Clerkenwell.&nbsp; I had, however, been by no means idle.&nbsp;
The resumption of my clothing was a matter of time and
difficulty; and though they had, by the kindness of the Governor,
been considerably taken in to suit my diminished proportions
(eighteen inches in the girth and seven stone in weight),
retained a hang-down appearance in the vicinity of the neck and
shoulders, that involved an immense expenditure of pins and
ingenuity.&nbsp; The clothes of prisoners after admission into
prison are, as a rule, subjected to a very necessary
process.&nbsp; I do not know whether any discretionary power
exists as to dispensing with the rule in certain cases, but it
seemed incredible that mine should have undergone the usual
formula without retaining a vestige of the fact.&nbsp; Clothes
are, however, subjected to a process of modified cremation, and
placed in airtight lockers, and smoked in a phosphoric
preparation supposed to be antagonistic to the respiratory organs
of creeping things.&nbsp; But the smell of fire had not passed
over mine, and I can only suppose that the ceremony had been
dispensed with as a <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>graceful compliment to the executors
of my deceased tailor, whose representative I last met at the
&ldquo;House of Detention.&rdquo;&nbsp; My hat, too, had either
considerably expanded, or my head had considerably contracted,
for it necessitated at least a yard of brown paper between the
brim and my cranium, before being padded to wearable
dimensions.</p>
<p>As I passed through the office, I caught the first glimpse of
myself in a respectably-sized looking-glass, and could hardly
believe that the scarecrow I saw was really myself.&nbsp; But
what mattered it if I had half a lung more or less than of
yore?&mdash;I was free!&nbsp; I was not going to die in prison,
and contribute in my person an additional item to the dead-house
inventory board.</p>
<p>With what different sensations did I again find myself in the
office which I had not entered since my arrival some months
before.&nbsp; It seemed as if all the formula would never be
completed, and I would almost have foregone the handsome donation
of ten shillings I had earned for laming malefactors to have got
out a moment earlier.&nbsp; But business is business, and the
labourer is worthy of <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>his hire, and in a few moments I had
received a rare gold coin (at least so it appeared to me at the
time), known as half-a-sovereign.&nbsp; The warder that had
accompanied me from the hospital now sent for a cab, and as I
drove through the ponderous gate a load appeared to fall off my
mind, and though shattered in health, as I breathed the free air
of a London fog, my lungs began to expand as they had not done
for months.</p>
<p>The usual hour for the jail delivery is 9 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, when gangs, varying from ten to a
hundred, are daily discharged.&nbsp; As they pass the wicket one
by one, each man is presented with a breakfast order, entitling
him to an unlimited supply of coffee and bread-and-butter at an
adjoining tavern.&nbsp; This kindly act takes its origin from a
private source that cannot be too highly commended, and though I
failed in discovering its identity, understand it is in no way
connected with the &ldquo;Prisoners&rsquo; Aid
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every detail connected with a prisoner on
discharge reflects credit on the Government.&nbsp; A vagrant
enters prison hungry, filthy, and penniless.&nbsp; He again
emerges with his linen washed, his clothes fumigated, money in
his pocket, and <a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>provided with an ample breakfast.&nbsp; Such treatment
has not its parallel in any other country in Europe, and I cannot
refrain from offering my testimony in opposition to the usually
accepted and erroneous impression, and confidently assert that
the British criminal is, if anything, far too generously treated
in every respect.</p>
<p>On my way I stopped at a tobacconist&rsquo;s and bought the
biggest cigar I could find.&nbsp; It was, I believe, a good one,
though for aught I knew it might have been brown paper.&nbsp; My
sense of taste had apparently forsaken me, and it was days before
I lost the sensation of having sucked a halfpenny.&nbsp; A friend
I met soon after did not at first recognise me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
gracious!&rdquo; he said, as he looked at my diminished
circumference, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not half the size you
were.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;you forget I&rsquo;ve been lately
<i>confined</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sense of taste that had apparently forsaken me was for a
time accompanied by a loss of voice; at least it seemed so, for
acting on the force of habit, I could not bring myself to
speaking above a whisper; and a waiter at the &mdash; Hotel
seemed to think he was serving a lunatic as I asked him <a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>in a
mysterious whisper for a pint of champagne.&nbsp; But the events
of the day were too much for my strength, and before 7 that
evening I had fainted, and was again in bed, under the care of an
eminent physician.&nbsp; A careful examination next day confirmed
the opinion of the prison surgeons, and I was ordered forthwith
to the South of France, or anywhere from cruel London.&nbsp; Door
handles caused me considerable surprise for days: they appeared,
indeed, as superfluous additions that I was totally unaccustomed
to.&nbsp; A morbid craving for old newspapers now seized me, and
I again discovered the importance that seemed to attach itself to
my late escapades.&nbsp; I am happily not a vain or unreasonable
being: had I been so I might have found ample grounds for either
when called upon to pay sixpence for a <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
and one shilling for a <i>Truth</i> at their respective offices,
for copies containing references to my case.&nbsp; As it was, I
merely concluded that the bump of avarice was equally developed
in the Jew and the Gentile newsvendor.</p>
<p>And now the time has come to close my reminiscences.&nbsp; To
continue them would be apt to lead <a name="page357"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>me into drivel, an adjunct I have
tried to avoid.&nbsp; I make no attempt at justifying my
work&mdash;though as a literary production it is beneath
criticism&mdash;being quite aware that many will consider my
resuscitating the past an act of bravado.&nbsp; In this I cannot
agree with them, for though guilty of a portion of the offence
with which I was charged, and which I unhesitatingly admitted, I
am happy to know that cruel circumstances prevented my refuting
at the time a fraction of the thousand and one lies that were
laid to my charge.&nbsp; Not the most trivial incident appears to
have passed unnoticed, and the omission to pay for a pennyworth
of bloaters has been since transformed into a crime, and carried,
as only cowards can, to quarters most likely to injure me.&nbsp;
And one scurrilous society journal, notorious for its
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; rather than its &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; had
the impudence to hint that I had made money at cards by foul play
(I who have lost a fortune by gambling); but this I attribute to
personal malice, and in return for my once publishing a scheme of
a shady nature projected by its owner.&nbsp; This precious
prospectus is in my possession, and at the service of any one
with a taste <a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
358</span>for the perusal of rascally documents.&nbsp; I had
indeed intended publishing it, but ultimately decided not to add
to this volume of horrors, on the principle that &ldquo;two
blacks don&rsquo;t make a white.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether it sees the
daylight at the next general election is another affair.&nbsp;
The marvel is I have not been associated with the &ldquo;Clapham
Junction Mystery,&rdquo; or discovered to be the chief of the
Russian Nihilists.&nbsp; These remarks are not incapable of
corroboration.&nbsp; The link then missing has since been found;
and more than one lawyer, and a certain high official, know the
truth; and the only deterrent to a very thorough
<i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the case is the pain it would
cause to others.&nbsp; For my own part, I should not object, and
if any shadow of the &ldquo;possibility&rdquo; of the truth
lurking in my assertion is to be extracted, it may commend itself
by the publicity I have given to my experiences&mdash;a frankness
not usually associated with <i>unmitigated</i> guilt.&nbsp; But
after all, is it worth it?&nbsp; For my part, I value the
world&rsquo;s patronage as much as I do its odium.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve tested and accurately appraised both!</p>
<p>My motive, too, has been to present prison life in a truer
light than I have hitherto seen <a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>described, and, with a few trifling
exceptions, and a necessary transposition of names and places, to
give the outer world an insight into that mysterious community
that lives and moves and has its being in their very midst.&nbsp;
The erroneous impression that exists as to the harsh treatment of
prisoners has, I trust, in a measure been removed.&nbsp; To
represent a prison as an elysium would be absurd.&nbsp; It is
intended as a deterrent, though considering the wild beasts it
has to deal with, it may be questioned whether it is not far too
considerate in the matter of food.&nbsp; Nor can it be denied
that the rules are framed, and their execution carried out by
officials actuated as a body by humane and honourable
principles.&nbsp; That there are black sheep in every grade must
also be conceded, and if their responsibilities were curtailed,
and in some cases transferred, considerable advantage would, I
think, ensue.&nbsp; A man of education and worldly experience,
circumstanced as I was, is probably capable of forming a juster
estimate of things as they really exist than a Governor or any
otherwise well-informed individual: and as my remarks have been
suggested in no spirit of acrimony, but, <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>on the
contrary, under a sense of obligation, it is to be hoped that the
seed sown in Clerkenwell may bring forth fruit in
Whitehall.&nbsp; That my remarks are disinterested nobody will be
foolish enough to deny, and whether acted on or not is a matter
of perfect indifference to me.&nbsp; At the same time, a probe
here and an inquiry there will manifest the weak points of the
&ldquo;system,&rdquo; and convince the highest in authority that
there are more things in a prison than are dreamt of in their
philosophy.&nbsp; My conclusions have been drawn in a great
measure from the treatment of others.&nbsp; For my own part, I
often fancy my past experiences are a dream, so difficult is it
to believe that the treatment I received, and immunity from
degrading employment except in name, are compatible with
&ldquo;imprisonment with hard labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if even
one of the many objects I have aspired to is attained, the blank
that divides the past from the future will not have been endured
in vain.</p>
<h2><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A RETROSPECT.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">cannot</span> conclude my story without
asking, What constitutes honesty? and if anybody can give a
really logical and satisfactory reply, I would ask him, Has he
ever met a really honest man?</p>
<p>In the conviction of being credited with a reprobate mind, I
freely admit my inability to answer either question
satisfactorily.&nbsp; It is my experience, indeed, that no such
thing as honesty&mdash;as at present understood&mdash;exists, and
that it is simply a question of time, circumstance, or
opportunity, although I have met many rich men who are credited
with this undefinable attribute.&nbsp; That men of means are
proverbially the best of fellows (I was once a &ldquo;best
fellow&rdquo; myself) need not be repeated, nor will I insult
your common sense, virtuous reader, who never did a shady thing
in your life, by telling you what everybody knows&mdash;that
their goodness <a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>increases in proportion to their wealth.&nbsp; Whether
they are really honest is another question, and though no one
would credit them with theft, would they be equally exemplary in
regard to filthier and more nameless crimes?&nbsp; Why should a
rich man steal?&nbsp; As a class they are proverbially mean and
selfish.&nbsp; Why, then, should they worry themselves with such
unnecessary consequences?&nbsp; That the highest of the so-called
aristocracy are not above suspicion may be remembered, when some
well-known names were once associated with a nasty scandal not
entirely composed of strawberry leaves; and if their better
halves were like C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wife, the immunity did not
extend to themselves.&nbsp; And a comparison of the men
undergoing penal servitude for huge commercial swindles, bogus
&ldquo;cab companies,&rdquo; and rascally prospectuses, with
others at large, less fortunate in finding dupes, only proves
that detection and want of opportunity have been left out of the
calculation; that &ldquo;not proven&rdquo; and
&ldquo;guilty&rdquo; are synonymous terms; and that at heart
prince and peasant, duke and dustman, are alike desperately
wicked.&nbsp; It was said, with a great deal of truth, that when
a certain projector contemplated another gigantic fraud on the
public <a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>it was his invariable custom to preface the robbery by
building a church&mdash;a hint that was not lost on the observant
speculator.&nbsp; In the same way, when a person thrusts himself
into prominence as the self-constituted scourge of erring
humanity, and is offensively blatant in his denunciations of
fraud, it may be reasonably assumed in nine cases out of ten that
the man is an undiscovered rogue, and fairly qualified for
&ldquo;Eighteen months&rsquo; imprisonment.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
